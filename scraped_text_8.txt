SUETONIUS THE 
            LIVES OF THE TWELVE CAESARS ~   THE 
            LIFE OF OTHO   ~   1.       The 
              ancestors of Otho came from an old and illustrious family in the 
              town of Ferentium and were descended from the princes of Etruria. 
              His grandfather Marcus Salvius Otho, whose father was a Roman knight 
              but whose mother was of lowly origin and perhaps not even free-born, 
              became a senator through the influence of Livia Augusta, in whose 
              house he was reared; but did not advance beyond the grade of praetor.
                   His father Lucius Otho was of a distinguished 
              family on his mother's side, with many powerful connections, and 
              was so beloved by Tiberius and so like him in appearance, that he 
              was believed by many to be the emperor's son. In the regular offices 
              at Rome, the proconsulate of Africa, and several special military 
              commands he conducted himself with extreme severity. In Illyricum 
              he even had the courage to punish some soldiers with death, because 
              in the rebellion of Camillus, repenting of their defection, they 
              had killed their officers on the ground that they were the ringleaders 
              in the revolt against Claudius; and they were executed in his presence 
              before his headquarters, although he knew that they had been promoted 
              to higher positions by Claudius because of that very act. By this 
              deed, while he increased his reputation, he lost favour at court; 
              but he speedily regained it by detecting the treachery of a Roman 
              knight, whose slaves betrayed their master's design of killing the 
              emperor. For in consequence of this, the senate conferred a very 
              unusual honour on him by setting up his statue in the Palace; and 
              Claudius also enrolled him among the patricians, and after praising 
              him in the highest terms, added this words: "a man of greater 
              loyalty than I can even pray for in my own children." By Albia 
              Terentia, a woman of an illustrious line, he had two sons, Lucius 
              Titianus and a younger called Marcus, who had the same surname as 
              himself; also a daughter, whom he betrothed to Drusus, son of Germanicus, 
              almost before she was of marriageable age. 2.       The 
              emperor Otho was born on the fourth day before the Kalends of May 
              in the consulate of Camillus Arruntius and Domitius Ahenobarbus. 
              From earliest youth he was so extravagant and wild that his father 
              often flogged him; and they say that he used to rove about at night 
              and lay hands on any one whom he met who was feeble or drunk and 
              toss him in a blanket.
                   After his father's death he pretended 
              love for an influential freedwoman of the court, although she was 
              an old woman and almost decrepit, that he might more effectually 
              win her favour. Having through her wormed his way into Nero's good 
              graces, he easily held the first place among the emperor's friends 
              because of the similarity of their characters; but according to 
              some, also through immoral relations. At any rate his influence 
              was such, that when he had bargained for a huge sum of money to 
              procure the pardon of an ex-consul who had been condemned for extortion, 
              he had no hesitation in bringing him into the senate to give thanks, 
              before he had fully secured his restoration. 3.       He 
              was privy to all the emperor's plans and secrets, and on the day 
              which Nero had chosen for the murder of his mother he gave both 
              of them a most elaborate banquet, in order to avert suspicion. Also 
              when Poppaea Sabina, who up to that time had been Nero's mistress, 
              was separated from her husband and turned over for the time being 
              to Otho, he pretended marriage with her; but not content with seducing 
              her he became so devoted that he could not endure the thought of 
              having Nero even as a rival. At all events it is believed that he 
              not only would not admit those whom Nero sent to fetch her, but 
              that on one occasion he even shut out the emperor himself, who stood 
              before his door, vainly mingling threats and entreaties and demanding 
              the return of his trust. Therefore Nero annulled the marriage and 
              under colour of an appointment as governor banished Otho to Lusitania, 
              contenting himself with this through fear that by inflicting a severer 
              punishment he would make the whole farce public; but even as it 
              was, it was published abroad in this couplet:                              "Why, 
              do you ask, in feigned honour does Otho in banishment languish? 
              
                                           With 
              his own wedded wife he had begun an intrigue."      With 
              the rank of quaestor Otho governed the province for ten years with 
              remarkable moderation and integrity. 4.       When 
              at last an opportunity for revenge was given him, Otho was the first 
              to espouse Galba's cause, at the same time conceiving on his own 
              account high hopes of imperial power, because of the state of the 
              times, but still more because of a declaration of the astrologer 
              Seleucus. For he had not only promised Otho some time before that 
              he would survive Nero, but had at this time unexpectedly appeared 
              unsought and made the further promise, that he would soon become 
              emperor as well.
                   Accordingly Otho let slip no opportunity 
              for flattery or attention to anyone. Whenever he entertained the 
              prince at dinner, he gave a gold piece to each man of the cohort 
              on guard, and put all the soldiers under obligation in one form 
              or another. Chosen arbiter by a man who was at law with his neighbour 
              about a part of his estate, he bought the whole property and presented 
              it to him. As a result there was hardly anyone who did not both 
              think and openly declare that he alone was worthy to succeed to 
              the empire. 5.       Now 
              he had hoped to be adopted by Galba, and looked forward to it from 
              day to day. But when Piso was preferred and he at last lost that 
              hope, he resorted to force, spurred on not merely by feelings of 
              resentment, but also by the greatness of his debts. For he flatly 
              declared that he could not keep on his feet unless he became emperor, 
              and that it made no difference whether he fell at the hands of the 
              enemy in battle or at those of his creditors in the Forum.
                   He had extorted a million sesterces 
              from one of the emperor's slaves a few days before for getting him 
              a stewardship. This was the entire capital for his great undertaking. 
              At first the enterprise was entrusted to five of his body-guard, 
              then to ten others, two being chosen by each of the first five; 
              to all of them ten thousand sesterces were paid at once and they 
              were promised fifty thousand more. Through these others were won 
              over, but not so very many, since he had full confidence that more 
              would join him when the business was afoot. 6.       He 
              had been inclined to seize the Camp immediately after the adoption, 
              and set upon Galba as he was dining in the Palace, but had been 
              prevented by consideration for the cohort which was on guard at 
              the time, and a reluctance to increase its ill repute; for it was 
              while that same cohort was at its post that both Galba had been 
              slain and Nero had been forsaken. The intervening time was lost 
              owing to bad omens and the warnings of Seleucus.
                   Accordingly, when the day was set, 
              after admonishing his confederates to await him in the Forum at 
              the golden mile-post hard by the temple of Saturn, he called upon 
              Galba in the morning and was welcomed as usual with a kiss. He also 
              attended the emperor as he was offering sacrifice, and heard the 
              predictions of the soothsayer. Then a freedman announced that the 
              architects had come, which was the signal agreed on, and going off 
              as if to inspect a house which was for sale, he rushed from the 
              Palace by a back door and hastened to the appointed place. Others 
              say that he feigned an attack of fever and asked those who stood 
              near him to give that excuse, in case he should be missed. Then 
              hurriedly entering a closed sedan, such as women use, he hurried 
              to the camp, but got out when the bearers' strength flagged, and 
              started to run. His shoe came untied and he stopped, whereupon without 
              delay he was at once taken up on the shoulders of his companions 
              and hailed as emperor. In this way he arrived at headquarters, amid 
              acclamations and drawn swords, while everyone whom he met fell in, 
              just as though he were an accomplice and a participator in the plot. 
              He then sent emissaries to kill Galba and Piso, and made no further 
              promises in the assembly to win the loyalty of the soldiers than 
              to declare that he would have that — and only that — which they 
              should leave to him. 7.       Next, 
              as the day was drawing to its close, he entered the senate and after 
              giving a brief account of himself, alleging that he had been carried 
              off in the streets and forced to undertake the rule, which he would 
              exercise in accordance with the general will, he went to the Palace. 
              When in the midst of the other adulations of those who congratulated 
              and flattered him, he was hailed by the common herd as Nero, he 
              made no sign of dissent; on the contrary, according to some writers, 
              he even made use of that surname in his commissions and his first 
              letters to some of the governors of the provinces. Certain it is 
              that he suffered Nero's busts and statues to be set up again, and 
              reinstated his procurators and freedmen in their former posts, while 
              the first grant that he signed as emperor was one of fifty million 
              sesterces for finishing the Golden House.
                   It is said that he had a fearful dream 
              that night, uttered loud groans, and was found by those who ran 
              to his aid lying on the ground beside his couch; that he tried by 
              every kind of expiatory rite to propitiate the shade of Galba, by 
              whom he dreamt that he was ousted and thrown out; and that next 
              day, as he was taking the auspices, a great storm arose and he had 
              a bad fall, whereat he muttered from time to time: "With 
              long pipes what concern have I?" 8.       Now 
              at about this same time the armies in Germany swore allegiance to 
              Vitellius. When Otho learned of this, he persuaded the senate to 
              send a deputation, to say that an emperor had already been chosen 
              and to counsel peace and harmony; but in spite of this he offered 
              Vitellius by messengers and letters a share in the imperial dignity 
              and proposed to become his son-in-law. But when it became clear 
              that war was inevitable, and the generals and troops which Vitellius 
              had sent in advance were already drawing near, he was given a proof 
              of the affection and loyalty of the praetorians towards himself 
              which almost resulted in the destruction of the senate. It had been 
              resolved that some arms should be removed and carried back on shipboard 
              by the marines; but as these were being taken out in the Camp towards 
              nightfall, some suspected treachery and started a riot; then on 
              a sudden all the soldiers hastened to the Palace without any particular 
              leader, demanding the death of the senators. After putting to flight 
              some of the tribunes who attempted to stop them, and killing others, 
              just as they were, all blood-stained, they burst right into the 
              dining-room, demanding to know where the emperor was; and they could 
              not be quieted until they had seen him.
                   He began his expedition with energy 
              and in fact too hastily, without any regard even for the omens, 
              and in spite of the fact that the sacred shields had been taken 
              out, but not yet put back, which for ages has been considered unlucky; 
              on the very day, too, when the worshippers of the Mother of the 
              Gods begin their wailing and lamentation, and also with most unfavourable 
              auspices. For having offered up a victim to father Dis, he had good 
              omens, whereas in such a sacrifice adverse indications are more 
              favourable; and when he first left the city, he was delayed by floods 
              of the Tiber, while at the twentieth milestone he found the road 
              blocked by fallen buildings. 9.       With 
              like rashness, although no one doubted that the proper course was 
              to protract the war, since the enemy were hard pressed by hunger 
              and by the narrowness of their quarters, he decided to fight a decisive 
              battle as soon as possible, either because he could not endure the 
              continued worry and hoped that the war could be ended before the 
              arrival of Vitellius, or from inability to resist the impetuosity 
              of his soldiers, who clamoured for the fight. He himself did not 
              take part in any of the battles, but remained behind at Brixellum.
                   He was victorious in three contests, 
              but they were of little moment: in the Alps, near Placentia, and 
              "at Castor's," as the place is called. In the final and 
              decisive struggle at Betriacum he was defeated, but through treachery. 
              For hope of a conference was offered, and when his soldiers were 
              led out in the belief that they were to discuss terms of peace, 
              a battle was forced upon them unexpectedly, just as they were exchanging 
              greetings with the foe. After the defeat, Otho at once resolved 
              to take his own life, rather from a feeling of shame, as many have 
              thought with good reason, and an unwillingness to persist in a struggle 
              for imperial power at the expense of such danger to life and property, 
              than from any despair of success or distrust of his troops; for 
              even then he had a fresh and strong force which he had held in reserve 
              for a second attempt, while others were on their way from Dalmatia, 
              Pannonia, and Moesia. Even the defeated troops were not so crushed 
              as not to undergo any danger, and even without support undertake 
              to avenge their disgrace. 10.       My 
              father Suetonius Laetus took part in that war, as a tribune of the 
              equestrian order in the Thirteenth legion. He used often to declare 
              afterwards that Otho, even when he was a private citizen, so loathed 
              civil strife, that at the mere mention of the fate of Brutus and 
              Cassius at a banquet he shuddered; that he would not have engaged 
              with Galba, if he had not felt confident that the affair could be 
              settled peacefully; further, that he was led to hold his life cheap 
              at that time by the example of a common soldier. This man on bringing 
              news of the defeat of the army was believed by no one, but was charged 
              by the soldiers now with falsehood and now with cowardice, and accused 
              of running away; whereupon he fell on his sword at the emperor's 
              feet. My father used to say that at this sight Otho cried out that 
              he would no longer endanger the lives of such brave men, who had 
              deserved so well.
                   Having therefore advised his brother, 
              his nephew, and his friends one by one to look out each for his 
              own safety as best they could, he embraced and kissed them all and 
              sent them off. Then going to a retired place he wrote two notes, 
              one of consolation to his sister, and one to Nero's widow Messalina, 
              whom he had intended to marry, commending to her his corpse and 
              his memory. Then he burned all his letters, to prevent them from 
              bringing danger or harm to anyone at the hands of the victor. He 
              also distributed what money he had with him among his servants. 11.       When 
              he had thus made his preparations and was now resolved upon death, 
              learning from a disturbance which meantime arose that those who 
              were beginning to depart and leave the camp were being seized and 
              detained as deserters, he said "Let us add this one more night 
              to our life" (these were his very words), and he forbade the 
              offering of violence to anyone. Leaving the door of his bedroom 
              open until a late hour, he gave the privilege of speaking with him 
              to all who wished to come in. After that, quenching his thirst with 
              a draught of cold water, he caught up two daggers, and having tried 
              the point of both of them, put one under his pillow. Then closing 
              the doors, he slept very soundly. When he at last woke up at about 
              daylight, he stabbed himself with a single stroke under the left 
              breast; and now concealing the wound, and now showing it to those 
              who rushed in at his first groan, he breathed his last and was hastily 
              buried (for such were his orders) in the thirty-eighth year of his 
              age and on the ninety-fifth day of his reign.  12.       Neither 
              Otho's person nor his bearing suggested such great courage. He is 
              said to have been of moderate height, splay-footed and bandy-legged, 
              but almost feminine in his care of his person. He had the hair of 
              his body plucked out, and because of the thinness of his locks wore 
              a wig so carefully fashioned and fitted to his head, that no one 
              suspected it. Moreover, they say that he used to shave every day 
              and smear his face with moist bread, beginning the practice with 
              the appearance of the first down, so as never to have a beard; also 
              that he used to celebrate the rites of Isis publicly in the linen 
              garment prescribed by the cult. I am inclined to think that it was 
              because of these habits that a death so little in harmony with his 
              life excited the greater marvel. Many of the soldiers who were present 
              kissed his hands and feet as he lay dead, weeping bitterly and calling 
              him the bravest of men and an incomparable emperor, and then at 
              once slew themselves beside his bier. Many of those who were absent 
              too, on receiving the news attacked and killed one another from 
              sheer grief. In short the greater part of those who had hated him 
              most bitterly while he lived lauded him to the skies when he was 
              dead; and it was even commonly declared that he had put an end to 
              Galba, not so much for the sake of ruling, as of restoring the republic 
              and liberty.
