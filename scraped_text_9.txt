SUETONIUS THE 
            LIVES OF THE TWELVE CAESARS ~   THE 
            LIFE OF VITELLIUS   ~   1.       Of 
              the origin of the Vitellii different and widely varying accounts 
              are given, some saying that the family was ancient and noble, others 
              that it was new and obscure, if not of mean extraction. I should 
              believe that these came respectively from the flatterers and detractors 
              of the emperor, were it not for a difference of opinion about the 
              standing of the family at a considerably earlier date. We have a 
              book of Quintus Elogius addressed to Quintus Vitellius, quaestor 
              of the Deified Augustus, in which it is written that the Vitellii 
              were sprung from Faunus, king of the Aborigines, and Vitellia, who 
              was worshipped as a goddess in many places; and that they ruled 
              in all Latium. That the surviving members of the family moved from 
              the Sabine district to Rome and were enrolled among the patricians. 
              That traces of this stock endured long afterwards in the Vitellian 
              Road, running from the Janiculum all the way to the sea, as well 
              as in a colony of the same name, which in ancient days the family 
              had asked the privilege of defending against the Aequicoli with 
              troops raised from their own line. That when afterwards a force 
              was sent into Apulia at the time of the Samnite war, some of the 
              Vitellii settled at Nuceria, and that after a long time their descendants 
              returned to the city and resumed their place in the senatorial order. 2.       On 
              the other hand several have written that the founder of the family 
              was a freedman, while Cassius Severus and others as well say further 
              that he was a cobbler, and that his son, after making a considerable 
              fortune from the sale of confiscated estates and the profession 
              of informer, married a common strumpet, daughter of one Antiochus 
              who kept a bakery, and became the father of a Roman knight. But 
              this difference of opinion may be left unsettled.
                   In any event Publius Vitellius of 
              Nuceria, whether of ancient stock or of parents and forefathers 
              in whom he could take no pride, unquestionably a Roman knight and 
              a steward of Augustus's property, left four sons of high rank with 
              the same name and differing only in their forenames: Aulus, Quintus, 
              Publius and Lucius. Aulus, who was given to luxury and especially 
              notorious for the magnificence of his feasts, died a consul, appointed 
              to the office with Domitius, father of the emperor Nero. Quintus 
              lost his rank at the time when it was resolved, under the suggestion 
              of Tiberius, to depose and get rid of undesirable senators. Publius, 
              a member of Germanicus' staff, arraigned Gnaeus Piso, the enemy 
              and murderer of his commander, and secured his condemnation. Arrested 
              among the accomplices of Sejanus, after holding the praetorship, 
              and handed over to his own brother to be kept in confinement, he 
              opened his veins with a penknife, but allowed himself to be bandaged 
              and restored, not so much from unwillingness to die, as because 
              of the entreaties of his friends; and he met a natural death while 
              still in confinement. Lucius attained the consulate and then was 
              made governor of Syria, where with supreme diplomacy having not 
              only induced Artabanus, king of the Parthians, to hold a conference 
              with him, but even to do obeisance to the standards of the legion. 
              Later he held, with the emperor Claudius, two more regular consulships 
              and the censorship. He also bore the charge of the empire while 
              Claudius was away on his expedition to Britain. He was an honest 
              and active man, but of very ill repute because of his passion for 
              a freedwoman, which went so far that he used her spittle mixed with 
              honey to rub on his throat and jaws as a medicine, not secretly 
              nor seldom, but openly and every day. He had also a wonderful gift 
              for flattery and was the first to begin to worship Gaius Caesar 
              as a god; for on his return from Syria he did not presume to approach 
              the emperor except with veiled head, turning himself about and then 
              prostrating himself. To neglect no means of gaining the favour of 
              Claudius, who was a slave to his wives and freedmen, he begged of 
              Messalina as the highest possible favour that she would allow him 
              to take off her shoes; and when he had taken off her right slipper, 
              he constantly carried it about between his toga and his tunic, and 
              sometimes kissed it. Narcissus also and Pallas he honoured by cherishing 
              their golden images among his household gods. It was he who made 
              the famous remark, "May you often do it," when he was 
              congratulating Claudius at the celebration of the Secular games. 3.       He 
              died of a paralytic stroke on the second day after he was seized, 
              leaving two sons, begotten of Sestilia, a most worthy woman and 
              of no mean family, and having lived to see them consuls both in 
              the same year, and for the whole year, since the younger succeeded 
              the elder for six months. On his decease the senate honoured him 
              with a public funeral and with a statue on the rostra with this 
              inscription: "Of unwavering loyalty to his emperor."
                   The emperor Aulus Vitellius, son of 
              Lucius, was born on the eighth day before the Kalends of October, 
              or according to some, on the seventh day before the Ides of September, 
              in the consulship of Drusus Caesar and Norbanus Flaccus. His parents 
              were so aghast at his horoscope as announced by the astrologers, 
              that his father tried his utmost, while he lived, to prevent the 
              assignment of any province to his son; and when he was sent to the 
              legions and hailed as emperor, his mother immediately mourned over 
              him as lost. He spent his boyhood and early youth at Capreae among 
              the wantons of Tiberius, being branded for all time with the nickname 
              Spintria and suspected of having been the cause of his father's 
              first advancement at the expense of his own chastity. 4.       Stained 
              by every sort of baseness as he advanced in years, he held a prominent 
              place at court, winning the intimacy of Gaius by his devotion to 
              driving and of Claudius by his passion for dice. But he was still 
              dearer to Nero, not only because of these same qualities, but because 
              of a special service besides; for when he was presiding at the contests 
              of the Neronia and Nero wished to compete among the lyre-players, 
              but did not venture to do so although there was a general demand 
              for him and accordingly left the theatre, Vitellius called him back, 
              alleging that he came as an envoy from the insistent people, and 
              thus gave Nero a chance to yield to their entreaties. 5.       Having 
              in this way through the favour of three emperors been honoured not 
              only with political positions but with distinguished priesthoods 
              as well, he afterwards governed Africa as proconsul and served as 
              curator of public works, but with varying purpose and reputation. 
              In his province he showed exceptional integrity for two successive 
              years, for he served as deputy to his brother, who succeeded him; 
              but in his city offices he was said to have stolen some of the offerings 
              and ornaments from the temples and changed others, substituting 
              tin and brass for gold and silver. 6.       He 
              had to wife Petronia, daughter of an ex-consul, and by her a son 
              Petronianus, who was blind in one eye. Since this son was named 
              as his mother's heir on condition of being freed from his father's 
              authority, he manumitted him, but shortly afterwards killed him, 
              according to the general belief, charging him besides with attempted 
              parricide, and alleging that his guilty conscience had led him to 
              drink the poison which he had mixed for his intended crime. Soon 
              afterwards he married Galeria Fundana, daughter of an ex-praetor, 
              and from her too he had a son and a daughter, but the former stammered 
              so, that he was all but dumb and tongue-tied. 7.       Galba 
              surprised everyone by sending him to Lower Germany. Some think that 
              it was due to Titus Vinius, who had great influence at the time, 
              and whose friendship Vitellius had long since won through their 
              common support of the Blues. But since Galba openly declared that 
              no men were less to be feared than those who thought of nothing 
              but eating, and that Vitellius's bottomless gullet might be filled 
              from the resources of the province, it is clear to anyone that he 
              was chosen rather through contempt than favour. It is notorious 
              that when he was about to start, he lacked means for his travelling 
              expenses, and that his need of funds was such, that after consigning 
              his wife and children, whom he left in Rome, to a hired garret, 
              he let his house for the rest of the year; and that he took a valuable 
              pearl from his mother's ear and pawned it, to defray the expenses 
              of his journey. He had to resort to false accusation to get rid 
              of the throng of creditors that lay in wait for him and tried to 
              detain him, including the people of Sinuessa and of Formiae, whose 
              public revenues he had embezzled; for he brought an action for damages 
              against a freedman who was somewhat persistent in demanding what 
              was due to him, alleging that he had been kicked by him, and would 
              not let him off until he had squeezed him to the tune of fifty thousand 
              sesterces.
                   On his arrival the army, which was 
              disaffected towards the emperor and inclined to mutiny, received 
              him gladly with open arms, as if he had come to them as a gift from 
              the gods; since he was the son of a man who had thrice been consul, 
              in the prime of life, and of an easy-going and lavish disposition. 
              This earlier good opinion Vitellius had also strengthened by recent 
              acts, for throughout the march he kissed even the common soldiers 
              whom he met, and at the posthouses and inns he was unusually affable 
              to the mule drivers and travellers, asking each of them in the morning 
              whether they had breakfasted and even showing by belching that he 
              had done so. 8.       As 
              soon as he had entered the camp, he granted every request that anyone 
              made and even of his own accord freed those in disgrace from their 
              penalties, defendants of suits from their mourning, and the convicted 
              from punishment. Therefore hardly a month had passed, when the soldiers, 
              regardless of the hour, for it was already evening, hastily took 
              him from his bedroom, just as he was, in his common house-clothes, 
              and hailed him as emperor. Then he was carried about the most populous 
              villages, holding a drawn sword of the Deified Julius, which someone 
              had taken from a shrine of Mars and handed him during the first 
              congratulations. He did not return to headquarters until the dining-room 
              caught fire from the stove and was ablaze; and then, when all were 
              shocked and troubled at what seemed a bad omen, he said: "Be 
              of good cheer; to us light is given"; and this was his only 
              address to the soldiers. When he presently received the support 
              of the army of the upper province too, which had previously transferred 
              its allegiance for Galba to the senate, he eagerly accepted the 
              surname of Germanicus, which was unanimously offered him, put off 
              accepting the title of Augustus, and forever refused that of Caesar. 9.       Then 
              hearing of the murder of Galba, he settled affairs in Germany and 
              made two divisions of his forces, one to send on against Otho, and 
              the other to lead in person. The former was greeted with a lucky 
              omen at the start, for an eagle suddenly flew towards them from 
              the right and after hovering about the standards, slowly preceded 
              their line of march. But, on the contrary, when he himself began 
              his advance, the equestrian statues which were being set up everywhere 
              in his honour on a sudden all collapsed with broken legs, and the 
              laurel crown which he had put on with due ceremony fell into a running 
              stream. Later, as he was sitting in judgment on the tribunal at 
              Vienna, a cock perched on his shoulder and then on his head. And 
              the outcome corresponded with these omens; for he was not by his 
              own efforts able to retain the power which his lieutenants secured 
              for him. 10.       He 
              heard of the victory at Betriacum and of the death of Otho while 
              he was still in Gaul, and without delay by a single edict he disbanded 
              all the praetorian cohorts, as having set a pernicious example, 
              and bade them hand over their arms to their tribunes. Furthermore, 
              he gave orders that one hundred and twenty of them should be hunted 
              up and punished, having found petitions which they had written to 
              Otho, asking for a reward for services rendered in connection with 
              Galba's murder. These acts were altogether admirable and noble, 
              and such as to give hope that he would be a great prince, had it 
              not been that the rest of his conduct was more in harmony with his 
              natural disposition and his former habits of life than with imperial 
              dignity. For when he had begun his march, he rode through the middle 
              of the cities like a triumphing general, and on the rivers he sailed 
              in most exquisite craft wreathed with various kinds of garlands, 
              amid lavish entertainments, with no discipline among his household 
              or the soldiers, making a jest of the pillage and wantonness of 
              all his followers. For not content with the banquets which were 
              furnished them everywhere at public expense, they set free whatever 
              slaves they pleased, promptly paying those who remonstrated with 
              blows and stripes, often with wounds, and sometimes with death. 
              When he came to the plains where the battle was fought and some 
              shuddered with horror at the mouldering corpses, he had the audacity 
              to encourage them by the abominable saying, that the odour of a 
              dead enemy was sweet and that of a fellow-citizen sweeter still. 
              But nevertheless, the better to bear the awful stench, he openly 
              drained a great draught of unmixed wine and distributed some among 
              the troops. With equal bad taste and arrogance, gazing upon the 
              stone inscribed to the memory of Otho, he declared that he deserved 
              such a Mausoleum, and sent the dagger with which his rival had killed 
              himself to the Colony of Agrippina, to be dedicated to Mars. He 
              also held an all-night festival on the heights of the Apennines. 11.       Finally 
              he entered the city to the sound of the trumpet, wearing a general's 
              mantle and a sword at his side, amid standards and banners, with 
              his staff in military cloaks and his troops with drawn swords.
                   Then showing greater and greater disregard 
              for the laws of gods and men, he assumed the office of high priest 
              on the day of Allia, held elections for ten years to come, and made 
              himself consul for life. And to leave no doubt in anyone's mind 
              what model he chose for the government of the State, he made funerary 
              offerings to Nero in the middle of the Campus Martius, attended 
              by a great throng of the official priests; and when at the accompanying 
              banquet a flute-player was received with applause, he openly urged 
              him "to render something from the Master's Book as well"; 
              and when he began the songs of Nero, Vitellius was the first to 
              applaud him and even jumped for joy. 12.       Beginning 
              in this way, he regulated the greater part of his rule wholly according 
              to the advice and whims of the commonest of actors and chariot-drivers, 
              and in particular of his freedman Asiaticus. This fellow had immoral 
              relations with Vitellius in his youth, but later grew weary of him 
              and ran away. When Vitellius came upon him selling posca 
              at Puteoli, he put him in irons, but at once freed him again and 
              made him his favourite. His vexation was renewed by the man's excessive 
              insolence and thievishness, and he sold him to an itinerant keeper 
              of gladiators. When, however, he was once reserved for the end of 
              a gladiatorial show, Vitellius suddenly spirited him away, and finally 
              on getting his province set him free. On the first day of his reign 
              he presented him with the golden ring at a banquet, although in 
              the morning, when there was a general demand that Asiaticus be given 
              that honour, he had deprecated in the strongest terms such a blot 
              on the equestrian order. 13.       But 
              his besetting sins were luxury and cruelty. He divided his feasts 
              into three, sometimes into four a day, breakfast, luncheon, dinner, 
              and a drinking bout; and he was readily able to do justice to all 
              of them through his habit of taking emetics. Moreover, he had himself 
              invited to each of these meals by different men on the same day, 
              and the materials for any one of them never cost less than four 
              hundred thousand sesterces. Most notorious of all was the dinner 
              given by his brother to celebrate the emperor's arrival in Rome, 
              at which two thousand of the choicest fishes and seven thousand 
              birds are said to have been served. He himself eclipsed even this 
              at the dedication of a platter, which on account of its enormous 
              size he called the "Shield of Minerva, Defender of the City." 
              In this he mingled the livers of pike, the brains of pheasants and 
              peacocks, the tongues of flamingoes and the milt of lampreys, brought 
              by his captains and triremes from the whole empire, from Parthia 
              to the Spanish strait. Being besides a man of an appetite that was 
              not only boundless, but also regardless of time or decency, he could 
              never refrain, even when he sacrificing or making a journey, from 
              snatching bits of meat and cakes amid the altars, almost from the 
              very fire, and devouring them on the spot; and in the cookshops 
              along the road, viands smoking hot or even those left over from 
              the day before and partly consumed. 14.       He 
              delighted in inflicting death and torture on anyone whatsoever and 
              for any cause whatever, putting to death several men of rank, fellow 
              students and comrades of his, whom he had solicited to come to court 
              by every kind of deception, all but offering them a share in the 
              rule. This he did in various treacherous ways, even giving poison 
              to one of them with his own hand in a glass of cold water, for which 
              the man had called when ill of a fever. Besides he spared hardly 
              one of the money-lenders, contractors, and tax-gatherers who had 
              ever demanded of him the payment of a debt at Rome or of a toll 
              on a journey. When one of these had been handed over for execution 
              just as he was paying his morning call and at once recalled, as 
              all were praising the emperor's mercy, Vitellius gave orders to 
              have him killed in his presence, saying that he wished to feast 
              his eyes. In another case he had two sons who attempted to intercede 
              for their father put to death with him. A Roman knight also, who 
              cried as he was being taken off to execution, "You are my heir," 
              he compelled to show his will; and reading the one of the man's 
              freedmen was put down as joint-heir with himself, he ordered the 
              death both of the knight and the freedman. He even killed some of 
              the common people, merely because they had openly spoken ill of 
              the Blue faction, handing that they had ventured to do this from 
              contempt of himself and the anticipation of a change of rulers. 
              But he was especially hostile to writers of lampoons and to astrologers, 
              and whenever any one of them was accused, he put him to death without 
              trial, particularly incensed because after a proclamation of his 
              in which he ordered the astrologers to leave the city and Italy 
              before the Kalends of October, a placard was at once posted, reading: 
              "By proclamation of the Chaldeans, God bless the State! Before 
              the same day and date let Vitellius Germanicus have ceased to live." 
              Moreover, when his mother died, he was suspected of having forbidden 
              her being given food when she was ill, because a woman of the Chatti, 
              in whom he believed as he would in an oracle, prophesied that he 
              would rule securely and for a long time, but only if he should survive 
              his parent. Others say that through weariness of present evils and 
              fear of those which threatened, she asked poison of her son, and 
              obtained it with no great difficulty. 15.       In 
              the eighth month of his reign the armies of the Moesian provinces 
              and Pannonia revolted from him, and also in the provinces beyond 
              the seas those of Judaea and Syria, the former swearing allegiance 
              to Vespasian in his absence and the latter in his presence. Therefore, 
              to retain the devotion and favour of the rest of the people, there 
              was nothing that he did not lavish publicly and privately, without 
              any limit whatever. He also held a levy in the city, promising those 
              who volunteered not only their discharge upon his victory but also 
              the rewards and privileges given to veterans after their regular 
              term of service. Later, when his enemies were pressing him hard 
              by land and sea, he opposed to them in one quarter his brother with 
              a fleet manned by raw recruits and a band of gladiators, and in 
              another the forces and leaders who had fought at Betriacum. And 
              after he was everywhere either worsted or betrayed, he made a bargain 
              with Flavius Sabinus, the brother of Vespasian, that he should have 
              his own life and a hundred million sesterces. Thereupon he immediately 
              declared from the steps of the Palace before his assembled soldiers, 
              that he withdrew from the rule which had been given him against 
              his will; but when all cried out against this, he postponed the 
              matter, and after a night had passed, went at daybreak to the rostra 
              in mourning garb and with many tears made the same declaration, 
              but from a written document. When the people and soldiers again 
              interrupted him and besought him not to lose heart, vying with one 
              another in promising him all their efforts in his behalf, he again 
              took courage and by a sudden onslaught drove Sabinus and the rest 
              of the Flavians, who no longer feared an attack, into the Capitol. 
              Then he set fire to the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus and destroyed 
              them, viewing the battle and the fire from the house of Tiberius, 
              where he was feasting. Not long afterwards he repented of his action 
              and throwing the blame upon others, called an assembly and took 
              oath, compelling the rest to do the same, that there was nothing 
              for which he would strive more earnestly than for the public peace. 
              Then he took a dagger from his side and offered it first to the 
              consul, and when he refused it, to the magistrates, and then to 
              the senators, one by one. When no one would take it, he went off 
              as if he would place it in the temple of Concord; but when some 
              cried out that he himself was Concord, he returned and declared 
              that he would not only retain the steel but would also adopt the 
              surname Concordia. 16.       He 
              also persuaded the senate to send envoys with the Vestal virgins, 
              to sue for peace or at least to gain time for conference.
                   The following day, as he was waiting 
              for a reply, word was brought by a scout that the enemy were drawing 
              near. Then he was at once hurried into a sedan with only two companions, 
              a baker and a cook, and secretly went to his father's house on the 
              Aventine, intending to flee from there to Campania. Presently, on 
              a slight and dubious rumour that peace had been granted, he allowed 
              himself to be taken back to the Palace. Finding everything abandoned 
              there, and that even those who were with him were making off, he 
              put on a girdle filled with gold pieces and took refuge in the lodge 
              of the door-keeper, tying a dog before the door and putting a couch 
              and a mattress against it. 17.       The 
              foremost of the army had now forced their way in, and since no one 
              opposed them, were ransacking everything in the usual way. They 
              dragged Vitellius from his hiding-place and when they asked him 
              his name (for they did not know him) and if he knew where Vitellius 
              was, he attempted to escape them by a lie. Being soon recognised, 
              he did not cease to beg that he be confined for a time, even in 
              the prison, alleging that he had something to say of importance 
              to the safety of Vespasian. But they bound his arms behind his back, 
              put a noose about his neck, and dragged him with rent garments and 
              half-naked to the Forum. All along the Sacred Way he was greeted 
              with mockery and abuse, his head held back by the hair, as is common 
              with criminals, and even the point of a sword placed under his chin, 
              so that he could not look down but must let his face be seen. Some 
              pelted him with dung and ordure, others called him incendiary and 
              glutton, and some of the mob even taunted him with his bodily defects. 
              He was in fact abnormally tall, with a face usually flushed from 
              hard drinking, a huge belly, and one thigh crippled from being struck 
              once upon a time by a four-horse chariot, when he was in attendance 
              on Gaius as he was driving. At last on the Stairs of Wailing he 
              was tortured for a long time and then despatched and dragged off 
              with a hook to the Tiber. 18.       He 
              met his death, along with his brother and his son, in the fifty-seventh 
              year of his age, fulfilling the prediction of those who had declared 
              from an omen which befell him at Vienna, as we have stated, that 
              he was destined to fall into the power of some man of Gaul. For 
              he was slain by Antonius Primus, a leader of the opposing faction, 
              who was born at Tolosa and in his youth bore the surname Becco, 
              which means a rooster's beak.
