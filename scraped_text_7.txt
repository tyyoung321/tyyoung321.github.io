SUETONIUS THE 
            LIVES OF THE TWELVE CAESARS ~   THE 
            LIFE OF GALBA   ~   1.       The 
              race of the Caesars ended with Nero. That this would be so was shown 
              by many portents and especially by two very significant ones. Years 
              before, as Livia was returning to her estate near Veii, immediately 
              after her marriage with Augustus, an eagle which flew by dropped 
              into her lap a white hen, holding in its beak a sprig of laurel, 
              just as the eagle had carried it off. Livia resolved to rear the 
              fowl and plant the sprig, whereupon such a great brood of chickens 
              was hatched that to this day the villa is called Ad Gallinas, 
              and such a grove of laurel sprang up, that the Caesars gathered 
              their laurels from it when they were going to celebrate triumphs. 
              Moreover it was the habit of those who triumphed to plant other 
              branches at once in that same place, and it was observed that just 
              before the death of each of them the tree which he had planted withered. 
              Now in Nero's last year the whole grove died from the root up, as 
              well as all the hens. Furthermore, when shortly afterwards the temple 
              of the Caesars was struck by lightning, the heads fell from all 
              the statues at the same time, and his sceptre, too, was dashed from 
              the hand of Augustus. 2.       Nero 
              was succeeded by Galba, who was related in no degree to the house 
              of the Caesars, although unquestionably of noble origin and of an 
              old and powerful family; for he always added to the inscriptions 
              on his statues that he was the great-grandson of Quintus Catulus 
              Capitolinus, and when he became emperor he even displayed a family 
              tree in his hall in which he carried back his ancestry on his father's 
              side to Jupiter and on his mother's to Pasiphae, the wife of Minos. 3.       It 
              would be a long story to give in detail his illustrious ancestors 
              and the honorary inscriptions of the entire race, but I shall give 
              a brief account of his immediate family. It is uncertain why the 
              first of the Sulpicii who bore the surname Galba assumed the name, 
              and whence it was derived. Some think that it was because after 
              having for a long time unsuccessfully besieged a town in Spain, 
              he at last set fire to it by torches smeared with galbanum; 
              others because during a long illness he made constant use of galbeum, 
              that is to say of remedies wrapped in wool; still others, because 
              he was a very fat man, such as the Gauls term galba, or 
              because he was, on the contrary, as slender as the insects called 
              galbae, which breed in oak trees.
                   The family acquired distinction from 
              Servius Galba, who became consul and was decidedly the most eloquent 
              speaker of his time. This man, they say, was the cause of the war 
              with Viriathus, because while governing Spain as propraetor, he 
              treacherously massacred thirty thousand of the Lusitanians. His 
              grandson had been one of Caesar's lieutenants in Gaul, but angered 
              because his commander caused his defeat for the consulship, he joined 
              the conspiracy with Brutus and Cassius, and was consequently condemned 
              to death by the Pedian law. From him were descended the grandfather 
              and the father of the emperor Galba. The former, who was more eminent 
              for his learning than for his rank — for he did not advance beyond 
              the grade of praetor — published a voluminous and painstaking history. 
              The father attained the consulship, and although he was short of 
              stature and even hunchbacked, besides being only an indifferent 
              speaker, was an industrious pleader at the bar. He married Mummia 
              Achaica, the granddaughter of Catulus and great-granddaughter of 
              Lucius Mummius who destroyed Corinth; and later Livia Ocellina, 
              a very rich and beautiful woman, who however is thought to have 
              sought marriage with him because of his high rank, and the more 
              eagerly when, in response to her frequent advances, he took off 
              his robe in private and showed her his deformity, so as not to seem 
              to deceive her by concealing it. By Achaica he had two sons, Gaius 
              and Servius. Gaius, who was the elder, left Rome after squandering 
              the greater part of his estate, and committed suicide because Tiberius 
              would not allow him to take part in the allotment of the provinces 
              in his year. 4.       The 
              emperor Servius Galba was born in the consulship of Marcus Valerius 
              Messala and Gnaeus Lentulus, on the ninth day before the Kalends 
              of January, in a country house situated on a hill near Tarracina, 
              on the left as you go towards Fundi. Adopted by his stepmother Livia, 
              he took her name and the surname Ocella, and also changed his forename; 
              for he used Lucius, instead of Servius, from that time until he 
              became emperor. It is well known that when he was still a boy and 
              called to pay his respects to Augustus with others of his age, the 
              emperor pinched his cheek and said in Greek: "Thou too, child, 
              wilt have a nibble at this power of mine." Tiberius too, when 
              he heard that Galba was destined to be emperor, but in his old age, 
              said: "Well, let him live then, since that does not concern 
              me." Again, when Galba's grandfather was busy with a sacrifice 
              for a stroke of lightning, and an eagle snatched the intestines 
              from his hand and carried them to an oak full of acorns, the prediction 
              was made that the highest dignity would come to the family, but 
              late; whereupon he said with a laugh: "Very likely, when a 
              mule has a foal." Afterwards when Galba was beginning his revolt, 
              nothing gave him so much encouragement as the foaling of a mule, 
              and while the rest were horrified and looked on it as an unfavourable 
              omen, he alone regarded it as most propitious, remembering the sacrifice 
              and his grandfather's saying.
                   When he assumed the gown of manhood, 
              he dreamt that Fortune said that she was tired of standing before 
              his door, and that unless she were quickly admitted, she would fall 
              a prey to the first comer. When he awoke, opening the door of the 
              hall, he found close by the threshold a bronze statue of Fortune 
              more than a cubit high. This he carried in his arms to Tusculum, 
              where he usually spent the summer, and consecrated it in a room 
              of his house; and from that time on he honoured it with monthly 
              sacrifices and a yearly vigil.
                   Even before he reached middle life, 
              he persisted in keeping up an old and forgotten custom of his country, 
              which survived only in his own household, of having his freedmen 
              and slaves appear before him twice a day in a body, greeting him 
              in the morning and bidding him farewell at evening, one by one. 5.       Among 
              other liberal studies he applied himself to the law. He also assumed 
              a husband's duties, but after losing his wife Lepida and two sons 
              he had by her, he remained a widower. And he could not be tempted 
              afterwards by any match, not even with Agrippina, who no sooner 
              lost Domitius by death than she set her cap for Galba so obviously, 
              even before the death of his wife, that Lepida's mother scolded 
              her roundly before a company of matrons and went so far as to slap 
              her.
                   He showed marked respect to Livia 
              Augusta, to whose favour he owed great influence during her lifetime 
              and by whose last will he almost became a rich man; for he had the 
              largest bequest among her legatees, one of fifty million sesterces. 
              But because the sum was designated in figures and not written out 
              in words, Tiberius, who was her heir, reduced the bequest to five 
              hundred thousand, and Galba never received even that amount. 6.       He 
              began his career of office before the legal age, and in celebrating 
              the games of the Floralia in his praetorship he gave a new kind 
              of exhibition, namely of elephants walking the rope. Then he governed 
              the province of Aquitania for nearly a year and soon afterwards 
              held a regular consulship for six months; and it chanced that in 
              this office he succeeded Lucius Domitius, the father of Nero, and 
              was succeeded by Salvius Otho, the father of the emperor Otho, a 
              kind of omen of what happened later, when he became emperor between 
              the reigns of the sons of these two men.
                   Appointed governor of Upper Germany 
              by Gaius Caesar in room of Gaetulicus, the day after he appeared 
              before the legions he put a stop to their applause at a festival 
              which chanced to fall at that time, by issuing a written order to 
              keep their hands under their cloaks; and immediately this verse 
              was bandied about the camp: "Soldier, 
              learn to play the soldier; 'tis Galba, not Gaetulicus."      With 
              equal strictness he put a stop to the requests for furloughs. He 
              got both the veterans and the new recruits into condition by plenty 
              of hard work, speedily checked the barbarians, who had already made 
              inroads even into Gaul, and when Gaius arrived, Galba and his army 
              made such a good impression, that out of the great body of troops 
              assembled from all the provinces none received greater commendation 
              or richer rewards. Galba particularly distinguished himself, while 
              directing the military manoeuvres shield in hand, by actually running 
              for twenty miles close beside the emperor's chariot. 7.       When 
              the murder of Gaius was announced, although many urged Galba to 
              take advantage of the opportunity, he preferred quiet. Hence he 
              was in high favour with Claudius, became one of his staff of intimate 
              friends, and was treated with such consideration that the departure 
              of the expedition to Britain was put off because Galba was taken 
              with a sudden illness, of no great severity. He governed Africa 
              for two years with the rank of proconsul, being specially chosen 
              to restore order in the province, which was disturbed both by internal 
              strife and by a revolt of the barbarians. And he was successful, 
              owing to his insistence on strict discipline and his observance 
              of justice even in trifling matters. When provisions were very scarce 
              during a foray and a soldier was accused of having sold for a hundred 
              denarii a peck of wheat which was left from his rations, Galba gave 
              orders that when the man began to lack food, he should receive aid 
              from no one; and he starved to death. On another occasion when he 
              was holding court and the question of the ownership of a beast of 
              burden was laid before him, as the evidence on both sides was slight 
              and the witnesses unreliable, so that it was difficult to get at 
              the truth, he ruled that the beast should be led with its head muffled 
              up to the pool where it was usually watered, that it should then 
              be unmuffled, and should belong to the man to whom it returned of 
              its own accord after drinking. 8.       His 
              services in Africa at that time, and previously in Germany, were 
              recognised by the triumphal regalia and three priesthoods, for he 
              was chosen a member of the Fifteen, of the brotherhood of Titius, 
              and of the priests of Augustus. After that he lived for the most 
              part in retirement until about the middle of Nero's reign, never 
              going out even for recreation without taking a million sesterces 
              in gold with him in a second carriage; until at last, while he was 
              staying in the town of Fundi, Hispania Tarraconensis was offered 
              him. And it fell out that as he was offering sacrifice in a public 
              temple after his arrival in the province, the hair of a young attendant 
              who was carrying an incense-box suddenly turned white all over his 
              head, and there were some who did not hesitate to interpret this 
              as a sign of a change of rulers and of the succession of an old 
              man to a young one; that is to say, of Galba to Nero. Not long after 
              this lightning struck a lake of Cantabria and twelve axes were found 
              there, an unmistakable token of supreme power. 9.       For 
              eight years he governed the province in a variable and inconsistent 
              manner. At first he was vigorous and energetic and even over severe 
              in punishing offences; for he cut off the hands of a money-lender 
              who carried on his business dishonestly and nailed them to his counter; 
              crucified a man for poisoning his ward, whose property he was to 
              inherit in case of his death; and when the man invoked the law and 
              declared that he was a Roman citizen, Galba, pretending to lighten 
              his punishment by some consolation and honour, ordered that a cross 
              much higher than the rest and painted white be set up, and the man 
              transferred to it. But he gradually changed to sloth and inaction, 
              not to give Nero any cause for jealousy, and as he used to say himself, 
              because no one could be forced to render an account for doing nothing.
                   As he was holding the assizes at New 
              Carthage, he learned of the rebellion of the Gallic provinces through 
              an urgent appeal for help from the governor of Aquitania; then came 
              letters from Vindex, calling upon him to make himself the liberator 
              and leader of mankind. So without much hesitation he accepted the 
              proposal, led by fear as well as by hope. For he had intercepted 
              despatches ordering his own death, which had been secretly sent 
              by Nero to his agents. He was encouraged too, in addition to most 
              favourable auspices and omens, by the prediction of a young girl 
              of high birth, and the more so because the priest of Jupiter at 
              Clunia, directed by a dream, had found in the inner shrine of his 
              temple the very same prediction, likewise spoken by an inspired 
              girl two hundred years before. And the purport of the verses was 
              that one day there would come forth from Spain the ruler and lord 
              of the world. 10.       Accordingly, 
              pretending that he was going to attend to the manumitting of slaves, 
              he mounted the tribunal, on the front of which he had set up as 
              many images as he could find of those who had been condemned and 
              put to death by Nero; and having by his side a boy of noble family, 
              whom he had summoned for that very purpose from his place of exile 
              hard by in the Balearic Isles, he deplored the state of the times; 
              being thereupon hailed as emperor, he declared that he was their 
              governor, representing the senate and people of Rome. Then proclaiming 
              a holiday, he enrolled from the people of the province legions and 
              auxiliaries in addition to his former force of one legion, two divisions 
              of cavalry, and three cohorts. But from the oldest and most experienced 
              of the nobles he chose a kind of senate, to whom he might refer 
              matters of special importance whenever it was necessary. He also 
              chose young men of the order of knights, who were to have the title 
              of volunteers and keep guard before his bedchamber in place of the 
              regular soldiers, without losing their right to wear the gold ring. 
              He also sent proclamations broadcast throughout the province, urging 
              all men individually and collectively to join the revolution and 
              aid the common cause in every possible way.
                   At about this same time, during the 
              fortification of a town which he had chosen as the seat of war, 
              a ring of ancient workmanship was found, containing a precious stone 
              engraved with a Victory and a trophy. Immediately afterwards a ship 
              from Alexandria loaded with arms arrived at Dertosa without a pilot, 
              without a single sailor or passenger, removing all doubt in anyone's 
              mind that the war was just and holy and undertaken with the approval 
              of the gods. Then suddenly and unexpectedly the whole plan was almost 
              brought to naught. One of the two divisions of cavalry, repenting 
              of its change of allegiance, attempted to desert Galba as he was 
              approaching his camp and was with difficulty prevented. Some slaves 
              too, whom one of Nero's freedmen had given Galba with treachery 
              in view, all but slew him as he was going to the bath through a 
              narrow passage-way. In fact they would have succeeded, had they 
              not conjured one another not to miss the opportunity and so been 
              questioned as to what the opportunity was to which they referred; 
              for when they were put to the torture, a confession was wrung from 
              them. 11.       To 
              these great perils was added the death of Vindex, by which he was 
              especially panic-stricken and came near taking his own life, in 
              the belief that all was lost. But when some messengers came from 
              the city, reporting that Nero was dead and that all the people had 
              sworn allegiance to him, he laid aside the title of governor and 
              assumed that of Caesar. He then began his march to Rome in a general's 
              cloak with a dagger hanging from his neck in front of his breast; 
              and he did not resume the toga until he had overthrown those who 
              were plotting against him, Nymphidius Sabinus, prefect of the praetorian 
              guard at Rome, in Germany and Africa the governors Fonteius Capito 
              and Clodius Macer. 12.       His 
              double reputation for cruelty and avarice had gone before him; men 
              said that he had punished the cities of the Spanish and Gallic provinces 
              which had hesitated about taking sides with him by heavier taxes 
              and some even by the razing of their walls, putting to death the 
              governors and imperial deputies along with their wives and children. 
              Further, that he had melted down a golden crown of fifteen pounds 
              weight, which the people of Tarraco had taken from their ancient 
              temple of Jupiter and presented to him, with orders that the three 
              ounces which were found lacking be exacted from them. This reputation 
              was confirmed and even augmented immediately on his arrival in the 
              city. For having compelled some marines whom Nero had made regular 
              soldiers to return to their former position as rowers, upon their 
              refusing and obstinately demanding an eagle and standards, he not 
              only dispersed them by a cavalry charge, but even decimated them. 
              He also disbanded a cohort of Germans, whom the previous Caesars 
              had made their body-guard and had found absolutely faithful in many 
              emergencies, and sent them back to their native country without 
              any rewards, alleging that they were more favourably inclined towards 
              Gnaeus Dolabella, near whose gardens they had their camp. The following 
              tales too were told in mockery of him, whether truly or falsely: 
              that when an unusually elegant dinner was set before him, he groaned 
              aloud; that when his duly appointed steward presented his expense 
              account, he handed him a dish of beans in return for his industry 
              and carefulness; and that when the flute player Canus greatly pleased 
              him, he presented him with five denarii, which he took from his 
              own purse with his own hand. 13.       Accordingly 
              his coming was not so welcome as it might have been, and this was 
              apparent at the first performance in the theatre; for when the actors 
              of an Atellan farce began the familiar lines "Here 
              comes Onesimus from his farm" all the spectators 
              at once finished the song in chorus and repeated it several times 
              with appropriate gestures, beginning with that verse. 14.       Thus 
              his popularity and prestige were greater when he won, than while 
              he ruled the empire, though he gave many proofs of being an excellent 
              prince; but he was by no means so much loved for those qualities 
              as he was hated for his acts of the opposite character.
                   He was wholly under the control of 
              three men, who were commonly known as his tutors because they lived 
              with him in the palace and never left his side. They were Titus 
              Vinius, one of his generals in Spain, a man of unbounded covetousness; 
              Cornelius Laco, advanced from the position of judge's assistant 
              to that of prefect of the Guard and intolerably haughty and indolent; 
              and his own freedman Icelus, who had only just before received the 
              honour of the gold ring and the surname of Marcianus, yet already 
              aspired to the highest office open to the equestrian order. To these 
              brigands, each with his different vice, he so entrusted and handed 
              himself over as their tool, that his conduct was far from consistent; 
              for now he was more exacting and niggardly, and now more extravagant 
              and reckless than became a prince chosen by the people and of his 
              time of life.
                   He condemned to death divers distinguished 
              men of both orders on trivial suspicions without a trial. He rarely 
              granted Roman citizenship, and the privileges of threefold paternity 
              to hardly one or two, and even to those only for a fixed and limited 
              time. When the jurors petitioned that a sixth division be added 
              to their number, he not only refused, but even deprived them of 
              the privilege granted by Claudius, of not being summoned for court 
              duty in winter and at the beginning of the year. 15.       It 
              was thought too that he intended to limit the offices open to senators 
              and knights to a period of two years, and to give them only to such 
              as did not wish them and declined them. He had all the grants of 
              Nero revoked, allowing only a tenth part to be retained; and he 
              exacted repayment with the help of fifty Roman knights, stipulating 
              that even if the actors and athletes had sold anything that had 
              formerly been given them, it should be taken away from the purchases, 
              in case the recipient had spent the money and could not repay it. 
              On the other hand, there was nothing that he did not allow his friends 
              and freedmen to sell at a price or bestow as a favour, taxes and 
              freedom from taxation, the punishment of the guiltless and impunity 
              for the guilty. Nay more, when the Roman people called for the punishment 
              of Halotus and Tigellinus, the most utterly abandoned of all Nero's 
              creatures, not content with saving their lives, he honoured Halotus 
              with a very important stewardship and in the case of Tigellinus 
              even issued an edict rebuking the people for their cruelty. 16.       Having 
              thus incurred the hatred of almost all men of every class, he was 
              especially detested by the soldiers; for although their officers 
              had promised them a larger gift than common when they swore allegiance 
              to Galba in his absence, so far from keeping the promise, he declared 
              more than once that it was his habit to levy troops, not buy them; 
              and on this account he embittered the soldiers all over the empire. 
              The praetorians he filled besides with both fear and indignation 
              by discharging many of them from time to time as under suspicion 
              of being partisans of Nymphidius. But loudest of all was the grumbling 
              of the army in Upper Germany, because it was defrauded of the reward 
              for its services against the Gauls and Vindex. Hence they were the 
              first to venture on mutiny, refusing on the Kalends of January to 
              swear allegiance to anyone save the senate, and at once resolving 
              to send a deputation to the praetorians with the following message: 
              that the emperor created in Spain did not suit them and the Guard 
              must choose one who would be acceptable to all the armies. 17.       When 
              this was reported to Galba, thinking that it was not so much his 
              age as his lack of children that was criticised, he picked out Piso 
              Frugi Licinianus from the midst of the throng at one of his morning 
              receptions, a young man of noble birth and high character, who had 
              long been one of his special favourites and always named in his 
              will as heir to his property and his name. Calling him son, he led 
              him to the praetorian camp and adopted him before the assembled 
              soldiers. But even then he made no mention of largess, thus making 
              it easier for Marcus Salvius Otho to accomplish his purpose within 
              six days after the adoption. 18.       Many 
              prodigies in rapid succession from the very beginning of his reign 
              had foretold Galba's end exactly as it happened. When victims were 
              being slain to right and left all along his route in every town, 
              an ox, maddened by the stroke of an axe, broke its bonds and charged 
              the emperor's chariot, and as it raised its feet, deluged him with 
              blood. And as Galba dismounted, one of his guards, pushed forward 
              by the crowd, almost wounded him with his lance. Again, as he entered 
              the city, and later the Palace, he was met by a shock of earthquake 
              and a sound like the lowing of kine. There followed even clearer 
              signs. He had set apart from all the treasure a necklace fashioned 
              of pearls and precious stones, for the adornment of his image of 
              Fortune at Tusculum. This on a sudden impulse he consecrated to 
              the Capitoline Venus, thinking it worthy of a more august position. 
              The next night Fortune appeared to him in his dreams, complaining 
              of being robbed of the gift intended for her and threatening in 
              her turn to take away what she had bestowed. When Galba hastened 
              in terror to Tusculum at daybreak, to offer expiatory sacrifices 
              because of the dream, and sent on men to make preparations for the 
              ceremony, he found on the altar nothing but warm ashes and beside 
              it an old man dressed in black, holding the incense in a glass dish 
              and the wine in an earthen cup. It was also remarked that as he 
              was sacrificing on the Kalends of January, the garland fell from 
              his head, and that as he took the auspices, the sacred chickens 
              flew away. As he was on the point of addressing the soldiers on 
              the day of the adoption, his camp chair, through the forgetfulness 
              of his attendants, was not placed on the tribunal, as is customary, 
              and in the senate his curule chair was set wrong side foremost. 19.       As 
              he was offering sacrifice on the morning before he was killed, a 
              soothsayer warned him again and again to look out for danger, since 
              assassins were not far off.
                   Not long after this he learned that 
              Otho held possession of the Camp, and when several advised him to 
              proceed thither as soon as possible — for they said that he could 
              win the day by his presence and prestige — he decided to do no more 
              than hold his present position and strengthen it by getting together 
              a guard of the legionaries, who were encamped in many different 
              quarters of the city. He did however put on a linen cuirass, though 
              he openly declared that it would afford little protection against 
              so many swords. But he was lured out by false reports, circulated 
              by the conspirators to induce him to appear in public; for when 
              a few rashly assured him that the trouble was over, that the rebels 
              had been overthrown, and that the rest were coming in a body to 
              offer their congratulations, ready to submit to all his orders, 
              he went out to meet them with so much confidence, that when one 
              of the soldiers boasted that he had slain Otho, he asked him, "On 
              whose authority?" and then he went on as far as the Forum. 
              There the horsemen who had been bidden to slay him, spurring their 
              horses through the streets and dispersing the crowd of civilians, 
              caught sight of him from a distance and halted for a moment. Then 
              they rushed upon him again and butchered him, abandoned by his followers. 20.       Some 
              say that at the beginning of the disturbance he cried out, "What 
              mean you, fellow soldiers? I am yours and you are mine," and 
              that he even promised them largess. But the more general account 
              is, that he offered them his neck without resistance, urging them 
              to do their duty and strike, since it was their will. It might seem 
              very surprising that none of those present tried to lend aid to 
              their emperor, and that all who were sent for treated the summons 
              with contempt except a company of German troops. These, because 
              of his recent kindness in showing them great indulgence when they 
              were weakened by illness, flew to his help, but through their unfamiliarity 
              with the city took a roundabout way and arrived too late.
                   He was killed beside the Lake of Curtius 
              and was left lying just as he was, until a common soldier, returning 
              from a distribution of grain, threw down his load and cut off the 
              head. Then, since there was no hair by which to grasp it, he put 
              it under his robe, but later thrust his thumb into the mouth and 
              so carried it to Otho. He handed it over to his servants and camp-followers, 
              who set it on a lance and paraded it about the camp with jeers, 
              crying out from time to time, "Galba, thou Cupid, exult in 
              thy vigour!" The special reason for this saucy jest was, that 
              the report had gone abroad a few days before, that when someone 
              had congratulated him on still looking young and vigorous, he replied: "As 
              yet my strength is unimpaired."      From 
              these it was bought by a freedman of Patrobius Neronianus for a 
              hundred pieces of gold and thrown aside in the place where his patron 
              had been executed by Galba's order. At last, however, his steward 
              Argivus consigned it to the tomb with the rest of the body in Galba's 
              private gardens on the Aurelian Road. 21.       He 
              was of average height, very bald, with blue eyes and a hooked nose. 
              His hands and feet were so distorted by gout that he could not endure 
              a shoe for long, unroll a book, or even hold one. The flesh on his 
              right side too had grown out and hung down to such an extent, that 
              it could with difficulty be held in place by a bandage. 22.       It 
              is said that he was a heavy eater and in winter time was in the 
              habit of taking food even before daylight, while at dinner he helped 
              himself so lavishly that he would have the leavings which remained 
              in a heap before him passed along and distributed among the attendants 
              who waited on him. He was more inclined to unnatural desire, and 
              in gratifying it preferred full-grown, strong men. They say that 
              when Icelus, one of his old-time favourites, brought him news in 
              Spain of Nero's death, he not only received him openly with the 
              fondest kisses, but begged him to prepare himself with delay and 
              took him one side. 23.       He 
              met his end in the seventy-third year of his age and the seventh 
              month of his reign. The senate, as soon as it was allowed to do 
              so, voted him a statue standing upon a column adorned with the beaks 
              of ships, in the part of the Forum where he was slain; but Vespasian 
              annulled this decree, believing that Galba had sent assassins from 
              Spain to Judaea, to take his life.
