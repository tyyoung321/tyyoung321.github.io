SUETONIUS THE 
            LIVES OF THE TWELVE CAESARS ~   THE 
            LIFE OF JULIUS CAESAR   ~   1.       In 
              the course of his sixteenth year he lost his father. In the next 
              consulate, having previously been nominated priest of Jupiter, he 
              broke his engagement with Cossutia, a lady of only equestrian rank, 
              but very wealthy, who had been betrothed to him before he assumed 
              the gown of manhood, and married Cornelia, daughter of that Cinna 
              who was four times consul, by whom he afterwards had a daughter 
              Julia; and the dictator Sulla could by no means force him to put 
              away his wife. Therefore besides being punished by the loss of his 
              priesthood, his wife's dowry, and his family inheritances, Caesar 
              was held to be one of the opposite party. He was accordingly forced 
              to go into hiding, and though suffering from a severe attack of 
              quartan ague, to change from one covert to another almost every 
              night, and save himself from Sulla's detectives by bribes. But at 
              last, through the good offices of the Vestal virgins and of his 
              near kinsmen, Mamercus Aemilius and Aurelius Cotta, he obtained 
              forgiveness. Everyone knows that when Sulla had long held out against 
              the most devoted and eminent men of his party who interceded for 
              Caesar, and they obstinately persisted, he at last gave way and 
              cried, either by divine inspiration or a shrewd forecast: "Have 
              your way and take him; only bear in mind that the man you are so 
              eager to save will one day deal the death blow to the cause of the 
              aristocracy, which you have joined with me in upholding; for in 
              this Caesar there is more than one Marius." 2.       He 
              served his first campaign in Asia on the personal staff of Marcus 
              Thermus, governor of the province. Being sent by Thermus to Bithynia, 
              to fetch a fleet, he dawdled so long at the court of Nicomedes that 
              he was suspected of improper relations with the king; and he lent 
              colour to this scandal by going back to Bithynia a few days after 
              his return, with the alleged purpose of collecting a debt for a 
              freedman, one of his dependents. During the rest of the campaign 
              he enjoyed a better reputation, and at the storming of Mytilene 
              Thermus awarded him the civic crown. 3.       He 
              served too under Servilius Isauricus in Cilicia, but only for a 
              short time; for learning of the death of Sulla, and at the same 
              time hoping to profit by a counter revolution which Marcus Lepidus 
              was setting on foot, he hurriedly returned to Rome. But he did not 
              make common cause with Lepidus, although he was offered highly favourable 
              terms, through lack of confidence both in that leader's capacity 
              and in the outlook, which he found less promising than he had expected. 4.       Then, 
              after the civil disturbance had been quieted, he brought a charge 
              of extortion against Cornelius Dolabella, an ex-consul who had been 
              honoured with a triumph. On the acquittal of Dolabella Caesar determined 
              to withdraw to Rhodes, to escape from the ill-will which he had 
              incurred, and at the same time to rest and have leisure to study 
              under Apollonius Molo, the most eminent teacher of oratory of that 
              time. While crossing to Rhodes, after the winter season had already 
              begun, he was taken by pirates near the island of Pharmacussa and 
              remained in their custody for nearly forty days in a state of intense 
              vexation, attended only by a single physician and two body-servants; 
              for he had sent off his travelling companions and the rest of his 
              attendants at the outset, to raise money for his ransom. Once he 
              was set on shore on payment of fifty talents, he did not delay then 
              and there to launch a fleet and pursue the departing pirates, and 
              the moment they were in his power to inflict on them the punishment 
              which he had often threatened when joking with them. He then proceeded 
              to Rhodes, but as Mithridates was devastating the neighbouring regions, 
              he crossed over into Asia, to avoid the appearance of inaction when 
              the allies of the Roman people were in danger. There he levied a 
              band of auxiliaries and drove the king's prefect from the province, 
              thus holding the wavering and irresolute states to their allegiance. 5.       While 
              serving as military tribune, the first office which was conferred 
              on him by vote of the people after his return to Rome, he ardently 
              supported the leaders in the attempt to re-establish the authority 
              of the tribunes of the commons, the extent of which Sulla had curtailed. 
              Furthermore, through a bill proposed by one Plotius, he effected 
              the recall of his wife's brother Lucius Cinna, as well as of the 
              others who had taken part with Lepidus in his revolution and after 
              the consul's death had fled to Sertorius; and he personally spoke 
              in favour of the measure. 6.       When 
              quaestor, he pronounced the customary orations from the rostra in 
              praise of his aunt Julia and his wife Cornelia, who had both died. 
              And in the eulogy of his aunt he spoke in the following terms of 
              her paternal and maternal ancestry and that of his own father: "The 
              family of my aunt Julia is descended by her mother from the kings, 
              and on her father's side is akin to the immortal Gods; for the Marcii 
              Reges (her mother's family name) go back to Ancus Marcius, and the 
              Julii, the family of which ours is a branch, to Venus. Our stock 
              therefore has at once the sanctity of kings, whose power is supreme 
              among mortal men, and the claim to reverence which attaches to the 
              Gods, who hold sway over kings themselves."
                   In place of Cornelia he took to wife 
              Pompeia, daughter of Quintus Pompeius and granddaughter of Lucius 
              Sulla. But he afterward divorced her, suspecting her of adultery 
              with Publius Clodius; and in fact the report that Clodius had gained 
              access to her in woman's garb during a public religious ceremony 
              was so persistent, that the senate decreed that the pollution of 
              the sacred rites be judicially investigated. 7.       As 
              quaestor it fell to his lot serve in Further Spain. When he was 
              there, while making the circuit of the assize-towns, to hold court 
              under commission from the praetor, he came to Gades, and noticing 
              a statue of Alexander the Great in the temple of Hercules, he heaved 
              a sigh, and as if out of patience with his own incapacity in having 
              as yet done nothing noteworthy at a time of life when Alexander 
              had already brought the world to his feet, he straightway asked 
              for his discharge, to grasp the first opportunity for greater enterprises 
              at Rome. Furthermore, when he was dismayed by a dream the following 
              night (for he thought that he had offered violence to his mother) 
              the soothsayers inspired him with high hopes by their interpretation, 
              which was: that he was destined to rule the world, since the mother 
              whom he had seen in his power was none other than the earth, which 
              is regarded as the common parent of all mankind. 8.       Departing 
              therefore before his term was over, he went to the Latin colonies 
              which were in a state of unrest and meditating a demand for citizenship; 
              and he might have spurred them on to some rash act, had not the 
              consuls, in anticipation of that very danger, detained there for 
              a time the legions which had been enrolled for service in Cilicia. 9.       For 
              all that he presently made a more daring attempt at Rome; for a 
              few days before he entered upon his aedileship he was suspected 
              of having made a conspiracy with Marcus Crassus, an ex-consul, and 
              likewise with Publius Sulla and Lucius Autronius, who, after their 
              election to the consulship, had been found guilty of corrupt practices. 
              The design was to set upon the senate at the opening of the year 
              and put to the sword as many as they thought good; then Crassus 
              was to usurp the dictatorship, naming Caesar as his master of horse, 
              and when they had organized the state according to their pleasure, 
              the consulship was to be restored to Sulla and Autronius. This plot 
              is mentioned by Tanusius Geminus in his History, by Marcus Bibulus 
              in his edicts, and by Gaius Curio the elder in his speeches. Cicero 
              too seems to hint at it in a letter to Axius, where he says that 
              Caesar in his consulship established the despotism which he had 
              had in mind when he was aedile. Tanusius adds that Crassus, either 
              conscience-stricken or moved by fear, did not appear on the day 
              appointed for the massacre, and that therefore Caesar did not give 
              the signal which it had been arranged that he should give; and Curio 
              says that the arrangement was that Caesar should let his toga fall 
              from his shoulder. Not only Curio, but Marcus Actorius Naso as well 
              declare that Caesar made another plot with Gnaeus Piso, a young 
              man to whom the province of Spain had been assigned unasked and 
              out of the regular order, because he was suspected of political 
              intrigues at Rome; that they agreed to rise in revolt at the same 
              time, Piso abroad and Caesar at Rome, aided by the Ambrani and the 
              peoples beyond the Po; but that Piso's death brought both their 
              designs to naught. 10.       When 
              aedile, Caesar decorated not only the Comitium and the Forum with 
              its adjacent basilicas, but the Capitol as well, building temporary 
              colonnades for the display of a part of his material. He exhibited 
              combats with wild beasts and stage-plays too, both with his colleague 
              and independently. The result was that Caesar alone took all the 
              credit even for what they spent in common, and his colleague Marcus 
              Bibulus openly said that his was the fate of Pollux: "For," 
              said he, "just as the temple erected in the Forum to the twin 
              brethren, bears only the name of Castor, so the joint liberality 
              of Caesar and myself is credited to Caesar alone." Caesar gave 
              a gladiatorial show besides, but with somewhat fewer pairs of combatants 
              than he had purposed; for the huge band which he assemble from all 
              quarters so terrified his opponents, that a bill was passed limiting 
              the number of gladiators which anyone was to be allowed to keep 
              in the city. 11.       Having 
              won the goodwill of the masses, Caesar made an attempt through some 
              of the tribunes to have the charge of Egypt given him by a decree 
              of the commons, seizing the opportunity to ask for so irregular 
              an appointment because the citizens of Alexandria had deposed their 
              king, who had been named by the senate an ally and friend of the 
              Roman people, and their action was generally condemned. He failed 
              however because of the opposition of the aristocratic party; wishing 
              therefore to impair their prestige in every way he could, he restored 
              the trophies commemorating the victories of Gaius Marius over Jugurtha 
              and over the Cimbri and Teutoni, which Sulla had long since demolished. 
              Furthermore in conducting prosecutions for murder, he included in 
              the number of murderers even those who had received moneys from 
              the public treasury during the proscriptions for bringing in the 
              heads of Roman citizens, although they were expressly exempted by 
              the Cornelian laws. 12.       He 
              also bribed a man to bring a charge of high treason against Gaius 
              Rabirius, who some years before had rendered conspicuous service 
              to the senate in repressing the seditious designs of the tribune 
              Lucius Saturninus; and when he had been selected by lot to sentence 
              the accused, he did so with such eagerness, that when Rabirius appealed 
              to the people, nothing was so much in his favour as the bitter hostility 
              of his judge. 13.       After 
              giving up hope of the special commission, he announced his candidacy 
              for the office of pontifex maximus, resorting to the most lavish 
              bribery. Thinking on the enormous debt which he had thus contracted, 
              he is said to have declared to his mother on the morning of his 
              election, as she kissed him when he was starting for the polls, 
              that he would never return except as pontifex. And in fact he so 
              decisively defeated two very strong competitors (for they were greatly 
              his superiors in age and rank), that he polled more votes in their 
              tribes than were cast for both of them in all the tribes. 14.       When 
              the conspiracy of Catiline was detected, and all the rest of the 
              senate favoured inflicting the extreme penalty on those implicated 
              in the plot, Caesar, who was now praetor elect, alone proposed that 
              their goods be confiscated and that they be imprisoned each in a 
              separate town. Nay, more, he inspired such fear in those who favoured 
              severer measures, by picturing the hatred which the Roman commons 
              would feel for them for all future time, that Decimus Silanus, consul 
              elect, was not ashamed to give a milder interpretation to his proposal 
              (since it would have been humiliating to change it) alleging that 
              it had been understood in a harsher sense than he intended. Caesar 
              would have prevailed too, for a number had already gone over to 
              him, including Cicero, the consul's brother, had not the address 
              of Marcus Cato kept the wavering senate in line. Yet not even then 
              did he cease to delay the proceedings, but only when an armed troop 
              of Roman knights that stood on guard about the place threatened 
              him with death as he persisted in his headstrong opposition. They 
              even drew their swords and made such passes at him that his friends 
              who sat next him forsook him, while a few had much ado to shield 
              him in their embrace or with their robes. Then, in evident fear, 
              he not only yielded the point, but for the rest of the year kept 
              aloof from the House. 15.       On 
              the first day of his praetorship he called upon Quintus Catulus 
              to render an account owing to the people touching the restoration 
              of the Capitol, proposing a bill for turning over the commission 
              to another. But he withdrew the measure, since he could not cope 
              with the united opposition of the aristocrats, seeing that they 
              had at once dropped their attendance on the newly elected consuls 
              and hastily gathered in throngs, resolved on an obstinate resistance. 16.       Nevertheless, 
              when Caecilius Metellus, tribune of the commons, brought forward 
              some bills of a highly seditious nature in spite of the veto of 
              his colleagues, Caesar abetted him and espoused his cause in the 
              stubbornest fashion, until at last both were suspended from the 
              exercise of their public functions by a decree of the senate. Yet 
              in spite of this Caesar had the audacity to continue in office and 
              to hold court; but when he learned that some were ready to stop 
              him by force of arms, he dismissed his lictors, laid aside his robe 
              of office, and slipped off privily to his house, intending to remain 
              in retirement because of the state of the times. Indeed, when the 
              populace on the following day flocked to him quite of their own 
              accord, and with riotous demonstrations offered him their aid in 
              recovering his position, he held them in check. Since this action 
              of his was wholly unexpected, the senate, which had been hurriedly 
              convoked to take action about that very gathering, publicly thanked 
              him through its leading men; then summoning him to the House and 
              lauding him in the strongest terms, they rescinded their former 
              decree and restored him to his rank. 17.       He 
              again fell into danger by being named among the accomplices of Catiline, 
              both before the commissioner Novius Niger by an informer called 
              Lucius Vettius and in the senate by Quintus Curius, who had been 
              voted a sum of money from the public funds as the first to disclose 
              the plans of the conspirators. Curius alleged that his information 
              came directly from Catiline, while Vettius actually offered to produce 
              a letter to Catiline in Caesar's handwriting. But Caesar, thinking 
              that such an indignity could in no wise be endured, showed by appealing 
              to Cicero's testimony that he had of his own accord reported to 
              the consul certain details of the plot, and thus prevented Curius 
              from getting the reward. As for Vettius, after his bond was declared 
              forfeit and his goods seized, he was roughly handled by the populace 
              assembled before the rostra, and all but torn to pieces. Caesar 
              then put him in prison, and Novius the commissioner went there too, 
              for allowing an official of superior rank to be arraigned before 
              his tribunal. 18.       Being 
              allotted the province of Farther Spain after his praetorship, Caesar 
              got rid of his creditors, who tried to detain him, by means of sureties 
              and contrary both to precedent and law was on his way before the 
              provinces were provided for; possibly through fear of a private 
              impeachment or perhaps to respond more promptly to the entreaties 
              of our allies for help. After restoring order in his province, he 
              made off with equal haste, and without waiting for the arrival of 
              his successor, to sue at the same time for a triumph and the consulship. 
              But inasmuch as the day for the elections had already been announced 
              and no account be taken of Caesar's candidacy unless he entered 
              the city as a private citizen, and since his intrigues to gain exemption 
              from the laws met with general protest, he was forced to forgo the 
              triumph, to avoid losing the consulship.  19.       Of 
              the two other candidates for this office, Lucius Lucceius and Marcus 
              Bibulus, Caesar joined forces with the former, making a bargain 
              with him that since Lucceius had less influence but more funds, 
              he should in their common name promise largess to the electors from 
              his own pocket. When this became known, the aristocracy authorized 
              Bibulus to promise the same amount, being seized with fear that 
              Caesar would stick at nothing when he became chief magistrate, if 
              he had a colleague who was heart and soul with him. Many of them 
              contributed to the fund, and even Cato did not deny that bribery 
              under such circumstances was for the good of the commonwealth.
                   So Caesar was chosen consul with Bibulus. 
              With the same motives the aristocracy took care that provinces of 
              the smallest importance should be assigned to the newly elected 
              consuls; that is, mere woods and pastures. Thereupon Caesar, especially 
              incensed by this slight, by every possible attention courted the 
              goodwill of Gnaeus Pompeius, who was at odds with the senate because 
              of its tardiness in ratifying his acts after his victory over king 
              Mithridates. He also patched up a peace between Pompeius and Marcus 
              Crassus, who had been enemies since their consulship, which had 
              been one of constant wrangling. Then he made a compact with both 
              of them, that no step should be taken in public affairs which did 
              not suit any one of the three. 20.       Caesar's 
              very first enactment after becoming consul was, that the proceedings 
              both of the senate and of the people should day by day be compiled 
              and published. He also revived a by-gone custom, that during the 
              months when he did not have the fasces an orderly should walk before 
              him, while the lictors followed him. He brought forward an agrarian 
              law too, and when his colleague announced adverse omens, he resorted 
              to arms and drove him from the Forum; and when next day Bibulus 
              made complaint in the senate and no one could be found who ventured 
              to make a motion, or even to express an opinion about so high-handed 
              a proceeding (although decrees had often been passed touching less 
              serious breaches of the peace), Caesar's conduct drove him to such 
              a pitch of desperation, that from that time until the end of his 
              term he did not leave his house, but merely issued proclamations 
              announcing adverse omens.
                   From that time on Caesar managed all 
              the affairs of state alone and after his own pleasure; so that sundry 
              witty fellows, pretending by way of jest to sign and seal testamentary 
              documents, wrote "Done in the consulship of Julius and Caesar," 
              instead of "Bibulus and Caesar," writing down the same 
              man twice, by name and by surname. Presently too the following verses 
              were on everyone's lips:                                         "In 
              Caesar's year, not Bibulus', an act took place of late;
                                                      For 
              naught do I remember done in Bibulus' consulate."      The 
              plain called Stellas, which had been devoted to public uses by the 
              men of by-gone days, and the Campanian territory, which had been 
              reserved to pay revenues for the aid of the government, he divided 
              without casting lots among twenty thousand citizens who had three 
              or more children each. When the publicans asked for relief, he freed 
              them from a third part of their obligation, and openly warned them 
              in contracting for taxes in the future not to bid too recklessly. 
              He freely granted everything else that anyone took it into his head 
              to ask, either without opposition or by intimdating anyone who tried 
              to object. Marcus Cato, who tried to delay proceedings, was dragged 
              from the House by a lictor at Caesar's command and taken off to 
              prison. When Lucius Lucullus was somewhat too outspoken in his opposition, 
              he filled him with such fear of malicious prosecution, that Lucullus 
              actually fell on his knees before him. Because Cicero, while pleading 
              in court, deplored the times, Caesar transferred the orator's enemy 
              Publius Clodius that very same day from the patricians to the plebeians, 
              a thing for which Clodius had for a long time been vainly striving; 
              and that too at the ninth hour. Finally taking action against all 
              the opposition in a body, he bribed an informer to declare that 
              he had been egged on by certain men to murder Pompey, and to come 
              out upon the rostra and name the guilty parties according to a prearranged 
              plot. But when the informer had named one or two to no purpose and 
              not without suspicion of double-dealing, Caesar, hopeless of the 
              success of his over-hasty attempt, is supposed to have had him taken 
              off by poison. 21.       At 
              about the same time he took to wife Calpurnia, daughter of Lucius 
              Piso, who was to succeed him in the consulship, and affianced his 
              own daughter Julia to Gnaeus Pompeius, breaking a previous engagement 
              with Servilius Caepio, although the latter had shortly before rendered 
              him conspicuous service in his contest with Bibulus. And after this 
              new alliance he began to call upon Pompey first to give his opinion 
              in the senate, although it had been his habit to begin with Crassus, 
              and it was the rule for the consul in calling for opinions to continue 
              throughout the year the order which he had established on the Kalends 
              of January. 22.       Backed 
              therefore by his father-in-law and son-in-law, out of all the numerous 
              provinces he made the Gauls his choice, as the most likely to enrich 
              him and furnish suitable material for triumphs. At first, it is 
              true, by the bill of Vatinius he received only Cisalpine Gaul with 
              the addition of Illyricum; but presently he was assigned Gallia 
              Comata as well by the senate, since the members feared that even 
              if they should refuse it, the people would give him this also. Transported 
              with joy at this success, he could not keep from boasting a few 
              days later before a crowded house, that having gained his heart's 
              desire to the grief and lamentation of his opponents, he would therefore 
              from that time mount on their heads; and when someone insultingly 
              remarked that that would be no easy matter for any woman, he replied 
              in the same vein that Semiramis too had been queen in Syria and 
              the Amazons in days of old had held sway over a great part of Asia. 23.       When 
              at the close of his consulship the praetors Gaius Memmius and Lucius 
              Domitius moved an inquiry into his conduct during the previous year, 
              Caesar laid the matter before the senate; and when they failed to 
              take it up, and three days had been wasted in fruitless wrangling, 
              went off to his province. Whereupon his quaestor was at once arraigned 
              on several counts, as a preliminary to his own impeachment. Presently 
              he himself too was prosecuted by Lucius Antistius, tribune of the 
              commons, and it was only by appealing to the whole college that 
              he contrived not to be brought to trial, on the ground that he was 
              absent on public service. Then to secure himself for the future, 
              he took great pains always to put the magistrates for the year under 
              personal obligation, and not to aid any candidates or suffer any 
              to be elected, save such as guaranteed to defend him in his absence. 
              And he did not hesitate in some cases to exact an oath to keep this 
              pledge or even a written contract. 24.       When 
              however Lucius Domitius, candidate for the consulship, openly threatened 
              to effect as consul what he had been unable to do as praetor, and 
              to take his armies from him, Caesar compelled Pompeius and Crassus 
              to come to Luca, a city in his province, where he prevailed on them 
              to stand for a second consulship, to defeat Domitius; and he also 
              succeeded through their influence in having his term as governor 
              of Gaul made five years longer. Encouraged by this, he added to 
              the legions which he had received from the state others at his own 
              cost, one actually composed of men of Transalpine Gaul and bearing 
              a Gallic name too (for it was called Alauda), 
              which he trained in the Roman tactics and equipped with Roman arms; 
              and later on he gave every man of it citizenship. After that he 
              did not let slip any pretext for war, however unjust and dangerous 
              it might be, picking quarrels as well with allied, as with hostile 
              and barbarous nations; so that once the senate decreed that a commission 
              be sent to inquire into the condition of the Gallic provinces, and 
              some even recommended that Caesar be handed over to the enemy. But 
              as his enterprises prospered, thanksgivings were appointed in his 
              honour oftener and for longer periods than for anyone before his 
              time. 25.       During 
              the nine years of his command this is in substance what he did. 
              All that part of Gaul which is bounded by the Pyrenees, the Alps 
              and the Cévennes, and by the Rhine and Rhone rivers, a circuit of 
              some 3,200 miles, with the exception of some allied states which 
              had rendered him good service, he reduced to the form of a province; 
              and imposed upon it a yearly tribute of 40,000,000 sesterces. He 
              was the first Roman to build a bridge and attack the Germans beyond 
              the Rhine; and he inflicted heavy losses upon them. He invaded the 
              Britons too, a people unknown before, vanquished them, and exacted 
              moneys and hostages. Amid all these successes he met with adverse 
              fortune but three times in all: in Britain, where his fleet narrowly 
              escaped destruction in a violent storm; in Gaul, when one of his 
              legions was routed at Gergovia; and on the borders of Germany, when 
              his lieutenants Titurius and Aurunculeius were ambushed and slain. 26.       Within 
              this same space of time he lost first his mother, then his daughter, 
              and soon afterwards his grandchild. Meanwhile, as the community 
              was aghast at the murder of Publius Clodius, the senate had voted 
              that only one consul should be chosen, and expressly named Gnaeus 
              Pompeius. When the tribunes planned to make him Pompey's colleague, 
              Caesar urged them rather to propose to the people that he be permitted 
              to stand for a second consulship without coming to Rome, when the 
              term of his governorship drew near its end, to prevent his being 
              forced for the sake of the office to leave his province prematurely 
              and without finishing the war. On the granting of this, aiming still 
              higher and flushed with hope, he neglected nothing in the way of 
              lavish expenditure or of favours to anyone, either in his public 
              capacity or privately. He began a forum with the proceeds of his 
              spoils, the ground for which cost more than a hundred million sesterces. 
              He announced a combat of gladiators and a feast for the people in 
              memory of his daughter, a thing quite without precedent. To raise 
              the expectation of these events to the highest possible pitch, he 
              had the material for the banquet prepared in part by his own household, 
              although he had let contracts to the markets as well. He gave orders 
              that whenever famous gladiators fought without winning the favour 
              of the people, they should be rescued by force and kept for him. 
              He had the novices trained, not in a gladiatorial school by professionals, 
              but in private houses by Roman knights and even by senators who 
              were skilled in arms, earnestly beseeching them, as is shown by 
              his own letters, to give the recruits individual attention and personally 
              direct their exercises. He doubled the pay of the legions for all 
              time. Whenever grain was plentiful, he distributed it to them without 
              stint or measure, and now and then gave each man a slave from among 
              the captives. 27.       Moreover, 
              to retain his relationship and friendship with Pompey, Caesar offered 
              him his sister's granddaughter Octavia in marriage, although she 
              was already the wife of Gaius Marcellus, and asked for the hand 
              of Pompey's daughter, who was promised to Faustus Sulla. When he 
              had put all Pompey's friends under obligation, as well as the greater 
              part of the senate, through loans made without interest or at a 
              low rate, he lavished gifts on men of all other classes, both those 
              whom he invited to accept his bounty and those who applied to him 
              unasked, including even freedmen and slaves who were special favourites 
              of their masters or patrons. In short, he was the sole and ever 
              ready help of all who were in legal difficulties or in debt and 
              of young spendthrifts, excepting only those whose burden of guilt 
              or poverty was so heavy, or who were so given up to riotous living, 
              that even he could not save them; and to these he declared in the 
              plainest terms that what they needed was a civil war. 28.       He 
              took no less pains to win the devotion of princes and provinces 
              all over the world, offering prisoners to some by the thousand as 
              a gift, and sending auxiliary troops to the aid of others whenever 
              they wished, and as often as they wished, without the sanction of 
              the senate or people, besides adorning the principal cities of Asia 
              and Greece with magnificent public works, as well as those of Italy 
              and the provinces of Gaul and Spain. At last, when all were thunder-struck 
              at his actions and wondered what their purpose could be, the consul 
              Marcus Claudius Marcellus, after first making proclamation that 
              he purposed to bring before the senate a matter of the highest public 
              moment, proposed that a successor to Caesar be appointed before 
              the end of his term, on the ground that the war was ended, peace 
              was established, and the victorious army ought to be disbanded; 
              also that no account be taken of Caesar at the elections, unless 
              he were present, since Pompey's subsequent action had not annulled 
              the decree of the people. And it was true that when Pompey proposed 
              a bill touching the privileges of officials, in the clause whereby 
              he debarred absentees from candidacy for office he forgot to make 
              a special exception in Caesar's case, and did not correct the oversight 
              until the law had been inscribed on a tablet of bronze and deposited 
              in the treasury. Not content with depriving Caesar of his provinces 
              and his privilege, Marcellus also moved that the colonists whom 
              Caesar had settled in Novum Comum by the bill of Vatinius should 
              lose their citizenship, on the ground that it had been given from 
              political motives and was not authorized by the law. 29.       Greatly 
              troubled by these measures, and thinking, as they say he was often 
              heard to remark, that now that he was the leading man of the state, 
              it was harder to push him down from the first place to the second 
              than it would be from the second to the lowest, Caesar stoutly resisted 
              Marcellus, partly through vetoes of the tribunes and partly through 
              the other consul, Servius Sulpicius. When next year Gaius Marcellus, 
              who had succeeded his cousin Marcus as consul, tried the same thing, 
              Caesar by a heavy bribe secured the support of the other consul, 
              Aemilius Paulus, and of Gaius Curio, the most reckless of the tribunes. 
              But seeing that everything was being pushed most persistently, and 
              that even the consuls elect were among the opposition, he sent a 
              written appeal to the senate, not to take from him the privilege 
              which the people had granted, or else to compel the others in command 
              of armies to resign also; feeling sure, it was thought, that he 
              could more readily muster his veterans as soon as he wished, than 
              Pompey his newly levied troops. He further proposed a compromise 
              to his opponents, that after giving up eight legions and Transalpine 
              Gaul, he be allowed to keep two legions and Cisalpine Gaul, or at 
              least one legion and Illyricum, until he was elected consul. 30.       But 
              when the senate declined to interfere, and his opponents declared 
              that they would accept no compromise in a matter affecting the public 
              welfare, he crossed to Hither Gaul, and after holding all the assizes, 
              halted at Ravenna, intending to resort to war if the senate took 
              any drastic action against the tribunes of the commons who interposed 
              vetoes in his behalf. Now this was his excuse for the civil war, 
              but it is believed that he had other motives. Gnaeus Pompeius used 
              to declare that since Caesar's own means were not sufficient to 
              complete the works which he had planned, nor to do all that he had 
              led the people to expect on his return, he desired a state of general 
              unrest and turmoil. Others say that he dreaded the necessity of 
              rendering an account for what he had done in his first consulship 
              contrary to the auspices and the laws, and regardless of vetoes; 
              for Marcus Cato often declared, and took oath too, that he would 
              impeach Caesar the moment he had disbanded his army. It was openly 
              said too that if he was out of office on his return, he would be 
              obliged, like Milo, to make his defence in a court hedged about 
              by armed men. The latter opinion is the more credible one in view 
              of the assertion of Asinius Pollio, that when Caesar at the battle 
              of Pharsalus saw his enemies slain or in flight, he said, word for 
              word: "They would have it so. Even I, Gaius Caesar, after so 
              many great deeds, should have been found guilty, if I had not turned 
              to my army for help." Some think that habit had given him a 
              love of power, and that weighing the strength of his adversaries 
              against his own, he grasped the opportunity of usurping the despotism 
              which had been his heart's desire from early youth. Cicero too was 
              seemingly of this opinion, when he wrote in the third book of his 
              De Officiis that Caesar ever had upon his lips these lines of Euripides, 
              of which Cicero himself adds a version:                                              "If 
              wrong may e'er be right, for a throne's sake
                                                           Were 
              wrong most right:— be God in all else feared." 31.       Accordingly, 
              when word came that the veto of the tribunes had been set aside 
              and they themselves had left the city, he at once sent on a few 
              cohorts with all secrecy, and then, to disarm suspicion, concealed 
              his purpose by appearing at a public show inspecting the plans of 
              a gladiatorial school which he intended building, and joining as 
              usual in a banquet with a large company. It was not until after 
              sunset that he set out very privily with a small company, taking 
              the mules from a bakeshop hard by and harnessing them to a carriage; 
              and when his lights went out and he lost his way, he was astray 
              for some time, but at last found a guide at dawn and got back to 
              the road on foot by narrow by-paths. Then, overtaking his cohorts 
              at the river Rubicon, which was the boundary of his province, he 
              paused for a while, and realising what a step he was taking, he 
              turned to those about him and said: "Even yet we may draw back; 
              but once cross yon little bridge, and the whole issue is with the 
              sword." 32.       As 
              he stood in doubt, this sign was given him. On a sudden there appeared 
              hard by a being of wondrous stature and beauty, who sat and played 
              upon a reed; and when not only the shepherds flocked to hear him, 
              but many of the soldiers left their posts, and among them some of 
              the trumpeters, the apparition snatched a trumpet from one of them, 
              rushed to the river, and sounding the war-note with mighty blast, 
              strode to the opposite bank. Then Caesar cried: "Take we the 
              course which the signs of the gods and the false dealing of our 
              foes point out. The die is cast," said he. 33.       Accordingly, 
              crossing with his army, and welcoming the tribunes of the commons, 
              who had come to him after being driven from Rome, he harangued the 
              soldiers with tears, and rending his robe from his breast besought 
              their faithful service. It is even thought that he promised every 
              man a knight's estate, but that came of a misunderstanding: for 
              since he often pointed to the finger of his left hand as he addressed 
              them and urged them on, declaring that to satisfy all those who 
              helped him to defend his honour he would gladly tear this very ring 
              from his hand, those on the edge of the assembly, who could see 
              him better than they could hear his words, assumed that he said 
              what his gesture seemed to mean; and so the report went about that 
              he had promised them the right of the ring and four hundred thousand 
              sesterces as well. 34.       The 
              sum total of his movements after that is, in their order, as follows: 
              He overran Umbria, Picenum, and Etruria, took prisoner Lucius Domitius, 
              who had been irregularly named his successor, and was holding Corfinium 
              with a garrison, let him go free, and then proceeded along the Adriatic 
              to Brundisium, where Pompey and the consuls had taken refuge, intending 
              to cross the sea as soon as might be. After trying by every kind 
              of hindrance to prevent their sailing, he marched off to Rome, and 
              after calling the senate together to discuss public business, went 
              to attack Pompey's strongest forces, which were in Spain under command 
              of three of his lieutenants — Marcus Petreius, Lucius Afranius, 
              and Marcus Varro — saying to his friends before he left "I 
              go to meet an army without a leader, and I shall return to meet 
              a leader without an army." And in fact, though his advance 
              was delayed by the siege of Massilia, which had shut its gates against 
              him, and by extreme scarcity of supplies, he nevertheless quickly 
              gained a complete victory. 35.       Returning 
              thence to Rome, he crossed into Macedonia, and after blockading 
              Pompey for almost four months behind mighty ramparts, finally routed 
              him in the battle at Pharsalus, followed him in his flight to Alexandria, 
              and when he learned that his rival had been slain, made war on King 
              Ptolemy, whom he perceived to be plotting against his own safety 
              as well; a war in truth of great difficulty, convenient neither 
              in time nor place, but carried on during the winter season, within 
              the walls of a well-provisioned and crafty foeman, while Caesar 
              himself was without supplies of any kind and ill-prepared. Victor 
              in spite of all, he turned over the rule of Egypt to Cleopatra and 
              her younger brother, fearing that if he made a province of it, it 
              might one day under a headstrong governor be a source of revolution. 
              From Alexandria he crossed to Syria, and from there went to Pontus, 
              spurred on by the news that Pharnaces, son of Mithridates the Great, 
              had taken advantage of the situation to make war, and was already 
              flushed with numerous successes; but Caesar vanquished him in a 
              single battle within five days after his arrival and four hours 
              after getting sight of him, often remarking on Pompey's good luck 
              in gaining his principal fame as a general by victories over such 
              feeble foemen. Then he overcame Scipio and Juba, who were patching 
              up the remnants of their party in Africa, and the sons of Pompey 
              in Spain. 36.       In 
              all the civil wars he suffered not a single disaster except through 
              his lieutenants, of whom Gaius Curio perished in Africa, Gaius Antonius 
              fell into the hands of the enemy in Illyricum, Publius Dolabella 
              lost a fleet also off Illyricum, and Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus an 
              army in Pontus. Personally he always fought with the utmost success, 
              and the issue was never even in doubt save twice: once at Dyrrachium, 
              where he was put to flight, and said of Pompey, who failed to follow 
              up his success, that he did not know how to use a victory; again 
              in Spain, in the final struggle, when, believing the battle lost, 
              he actually thought of suicide. 37.       Having 
              ended the wars, he celebrated five triumphs, four in a single month, 
              but at intervals of a few days, after vanquishing Scipio; and another 
              on defeating Pompey's sons. The first and most splendid was the 
              Gallic triumph, after that the African, and finally the Spanish, 
              each differing from the rest in its equipment and display of spoils. 
              As he rode through the Velabrum on the day of his Gallic triumph, 
              the axle of his chariot broke, and he was all but thrown out; and 
              he mounted the Capitol by torchlight, with forty elephants bearing 
              lamps on his right and his left. In his Pontic triumph he displayed 
              among the show-pieces of the procession an inscription of but three 
              words, "I came, I saw, I conquered," not indicating the 
              events of the war, as the others did, but the speed with which it 
              was finished. 38.       To 
              each and every foot-soldier of his veteran legions he gave twenty-four 
              thousand sesterces by way of booty, over and above the two thousand 
              apiece which he had paid them at the beginning of the civil strife. 
              He also assigned them lands, but not side by side, to avoid dispossessing 
              any of the former owners. To every man of the people, besides ten 
              pecks of grain and the same number of pounds of oil, he distributed 
              the three hundred sesterces which he had promised at first, and 
              one hundred apiece to boot because of the delay. He also remitted 
              a year's rent in Rome to tenants who paid two thousand sesterces 
              or less, and in Italy up to five hundred sesterces. He added a banquet 
              and a dole of meat, and after his Spanish victory two dinners; for 
              deeming that the former of these had not been served with a liberality 
              creditable to his generosity, he gave another five days later on 
              a most lavish scale. 39.       He 
              gave entertainments of divers kinds: a combat of gladiators and 
              also stage-plays in every ward all over the city, performed too 
              by actors of all languages, as well as races in the circus, athletic 
              contests, and a sham sea-fight. In the gladiatorial contest in the 
              Forum Furius Leptinus, a man of praetorian stock, and Quintus Calpenus, 
              a former senator and pleader at the bar, fought to a finish. A Pyrrhic 
              dance was performed by the sons of the princes of Asia and Bithynia. 
              During the plays Decimus Laberius, a Roman knight, acted a farce 
              of his own composition, and having been presented with five hundred 
              thousand sesterces and a gold ring, passed from the stage through 
              the orchestra and took his place in the fourteen rows. For the races 
              the circus was lengthened at either end and a broad canal was dug 
              all about it; then young men of the highest rank drove four-horse 
              and two-horse chariots and rode pairs of horses, vaulting from one 
              to the other. The game called Troy was performed by two troops, 
              of younger and of older boys. Combats with wild beasts were presented 
              on five successive days, and last of all there was a battle between 
              two opposing armies, in which five hundred foot-soldiers, twenty 
              elephants, and thirty horsemen engaged on each side. To make room 
              for this, the goals were taken down and in their place two camps 
              were pitched over against each other. The athletic competitions 
              lasted for three days in a temporary stadium built for the purpose 
              in the region of the Campus Martius. For the naval battle a pool 
              was dug in the lesser Codeta and there was a contest of ships of 
              two, three, and four banks of oars, belonging to the Tyrian and 
              Egyptian fleets, manned by a large force of fighting men. Such a 
              throng flocked to all these shows from every quarter, that many 
              strangers had to lodge in tents pitched in streets or along the 
              roads, and the press was often such that many were crushed to death, 
              including two senators. 40.       Then 
              turning his attention to the reorganisation of the state, he reformed 
              the calendar, which the negligence of the pontiffs had long since 
              so disordered, through their privilege of adding months or days 
              at pleasure, that the harvest festivals did not come in summer nor 
              those of the vintage in the autumn; and he adjusted the year to 
              the sun's course by making it consist of three hundred and sixty-five 
              days, abolishing the intercalary month, and adding one day every 
              fourth year. Furthermore, that the correct reckoning of seasons 
              might begin with the next Kalends of January, he inserted two other 
              months between those of November and December; hence the year in 
              which these arrangements were made was one of fifteen months, including 
              the intercalary month, which belonged to that year according to 
              the former custom. 41.       He 
              filled the vacancies in the senate, enrolled additional patricians, 
              and increased the number of praetors, aediles, and quaestors, as 
              well as of the minor officials; he reinstated those who had been 
              degraded by official action of the censors or found guilty of bribery 
              by verdict of the jurors. He shared the elections with the people 
              on this basis: that except in the case of the consulship, half of 
              the magistrates should be appointed by the people's choice, while 
              the rest should be those whom he had personally nominated. And these 
              he announced in brief notes like the following, circulated in each 
              tribe: "Caesar the Dictator to this or that tribe. I commend 
              to you so and so, to hold their positions by your votes." He 
              admitted to office even the sons of those who had been proscribed. 
              He limited the right of serving as jurors to two classes, the equestrian 
              and senatorial orders, disqualifying the third class, the tribunes 
              of the treasury.
                   He made the enumeration of the people 
              neither in the usual manner nor place, but from street to street 
              aided by the owners of blocks of houses, and reduced the number 
              of those who received grain at public expense from three hundred 
              and twenty thousand to one hundred and fifty thousand. And to prevent 
              the calling of additional meetings at any future time for purposes 
              of enrolment, he provided that the places of such as died should 
              be filled each year by the praetors from those who were not on the 
              list. 42.       Moreover, 
              to keep up the population of the city, depleted as it was by the 
              assignment of eighty thousand citizens to colonies across the sea, 
              he made a law that no citizen older than twenty or younger than 
              forty, who was not detained by service in the army, should be absent 
              from Italy for more than three successive years; that no senator's 
              son should go abroad except as the companion of a magistrate or 
              on his staff; and that those who made a business of grazing should 
              have among their herdsmen at least one-third who were men of free 
              birth. He conferred citizenship on all who practised medicine at 
              Rome, and on all teachers of the liberal arts, to make them more 
              desirous of living in the city and to induce others to resort to 
              it.
                   As to debts, he disappointed those 
              who looked for their cancellation, which was often agitated, but 
              finally decreed that the debtors should satisfy their creditors 
              according to a valuation of their possessions at the price what 
              they had paid for them before the civil war, deducting from the 
              principal whatever interest had been paid in cash or pledged through 
              bankers; an arrangement which wiped out about a fourth part of their 
              indebtedness. He dissolved all guilds, except those of ancient foundation. 
              He increased the penalties for crimes; and inasmuch as the rich 
              involved themselves in guilt with less hesitation because they merely 
              suffered exile, without any loss of property, he punished murderers 
              of freemen by the confiscation of all their goods, as Cicero writes, 
              and others by the loss of one-half. 43.       He 
              administered justice with the utmost conscientiousness and strictness. 
              Those convicted of extortion he even dismissed from the senatorial 
              order. He annulled the marriage of an ex-praetor, who had married 
              a woman the very day after her divorce, although there was no suspicion 
              of adultery. He imposed duties on foreign wares. He denied the use 
              of litters and the wearing of scarlet robes or pearls to all except 
              those of a designated position and age, and on set days. In particular 
              he enforced the laws against extravagance, setting watchmen in various 
              parts of the market, to seize and bring to him dainties which were 
              exposed for sale in violation of the law; and sometimes he sent 
              his lictors and soldiers to take from a dining-room any articles 
              which had escaped the vigilance of his watchmen, even after they 
              had been served. 44.       In 
              particular, for the adornment and convenience of the city, also 
              for the protection and extension of the Empire, he formed more projects 
              and more extensive ones every day: first of all, to rear a temple 
              of Mars, greater than any in existence, filling up and levelling 
              the pool in which he had exhibited the sea-fight, and to build a 
              theatre of vast size, sloping down from the Tarpeian rock; to reduce 
              the civil code to fixed limits, and of the vast and prolix mass 
              of statutes to include only the best and most essential in a limited 
              number of volumes; to open to the public the greatest possible libraries 
              of Greek and Latin books, assigning to Marcus Varro the charge of 
              procuring and classifying them; to drain the Pomptine marshes; to 
              let out the water from Lake Fucinus; to make a highway from the 
              Adriatic across the submit of the Apennines as far as the Tiber; 
              to cut a canal through the Isthmus; to check the Dacians, who had 
              poured into Pontus and Thrace; then to make war on the Parthians 
              by way of Lesser Armenia, but not to risk a battle with them until 
              he had first tested their mettle.
                   All these enterprises and plans were 
              cut short by his death. But before I speak of that, it will not 
              be amiss to describe briefly his personal appearance, his dress, 
              his mode of life, and his character, as well as his conduct in civil 
              and military life. 45.       He 
              is said to have been tall of stature with a fair complexion, shapely 
              limbs, a somewhat full face, and keen black eyes; sound of health, 
              except that towards the end he was subject to sudden fainting fits 
              and to nightmare as well. He was twice attacked by the falling sickness 
              during his campaigns. He was somewhat overnice in the care of his 
              person, being not only carefully trimmed and shaved, but even having 
              superfluous hair plucked out, as some have charged; while his baldness 
              was a disfigurement would troubled him greatly, since he found that 
              it was often the subject of the gibes of his detractors. Because 
              of it he used to comb forward his scanty locks from the crown of 
              his head, and of all the honours voted him by the senate and people 
              there was none which he received or made use of more gladly than 
              the privilege of wearing a laurel wreath at all times. They say, 
              too, that he was remarkable in his dress; that he wore a senator's 
              tunic with fringed sleeves reaching to the wrist, and always had 
              a girdle over it, though rather a loose one; and this, they say, 
              was the occasion of Sulla's mot, when he often warned the nobles 
              to keep an eye on the ill-girt boy. 46.       He 
              lived at first in the Subura in a modest house, but after he became 
              pontifex maximus, in the official residence on the Sacred Way. Many 
              have water that he was very fond of elegance and luxury; that having 
              laid the foundations of a country-house on his estate at Nemi and 
              finished it at great cost, he tore it all down because it did not 
              suit him in every particular, although at the time he was still 
              poor and heavily in debt; and that he carried tesselated and mosaic 
              floors about with him on his campaigns. 47.       They 
              say that he was led to invade Britain by the hope of getting pearls, 
              and that in comparing their size he sometimes weighed them with 
              his own hand; that he was always a most enthusiastic collector of 
              gems, carvings, statues, and pictures by early artists; also of 
              slaves of exceptional figure and training at enormous prices, of 
              which he himself was so ashamed that he forbade his entry in his 
              accounts. 48.       It 
              is further reported that in the provinces he gave banquets constantly 
              in two dining-halls, in one of which his officers or Greek companions, 
              in the other Roman civilians and the more distinguished of the provincials 
              reclined at table. He was so punctilious and strict in the management 
              of his household, in small matters as well as in those of greater 
              importance, that he put his baker in irons for serving him with 
              one kind of bread and his guests with another; and he inflicted 
              capital punishment on a favourite freedman for adultery with the 
              wife of a Roman knight, although no complaint was made against him. 49.       There 
              was no stain on his reputation for chastity except his intimacy 
              with King Nicomedes, but that was a deep and lasting reproach, which 
              laid him open to insults from every quarter. I say nothing of the 
              notorious lines of Licinius Calvus:                                             "Whate'er 
              Bithynia had, and Caesar's paramour."      I 
              pass over, too, the invectives of Dolabella and the elder Curio, 
              in which Dolabella calls him "the queen's rival, the inner 
              partner of the royal couch," and Curio, "the brothel of 
              Nicomedes and the stew of Bithynia." I take no account of the 
              edicts of Bibulus, in which he posted his colleague as "the 
              queen of Bithynia," saying that "of yore he was enamoured 
              of a king, but now of a king's estate." At this same time, 
              so Marcus Brutus declares, one Octavius, a man whose disordered 
              mind made him somewhat free with his tongue, after saluting Pompey 
              as "king" in a crowded assembly, greeted Caesar as "queen." 
              But Gaius Memmius makes the direct charge that he acted as cup-bearer 
              to Nicomedes with the rest of his wantons at a large dinner-party, 
              and that among the guests were some merchants from Rome, whose names 
              Memmius gives. Cicero, indeed, is not content with having written 
              in sundry letters that Caesar was led by the king's attendants to 
              the royal apartments, that he lay on a golden couch arrayed in purple, 
              and that the virginity of this son of Venus was lost in Bithynia; 
              but when Caesar was once addressing the senate in defence of Nysa, 
              daughter of Nicomedes, and was enumerating his obligations to the 
              king, Cicero cried: "No more of that, pray, for it is well 
              known what he gave you, and what you gave him in turn." Finally, 
              in his Gallic triumph his soldiers, among the bantering songs which 
              are usually sung by those who followed the chariot, shouted these 
              lines, which became a by-word:                                  "All 
              the Gauls did Caesar vanquish, Nicomedes vanquished him; 
                                               Lo! 
              now Caesar rides in triumph, victor over all the Gauls, 
                                               Nicomedes 
              does not triumph, who subdued the conqueror." 50.       That 
              he was unbridled and extravagant in his intrigues is the general 
              opinion, and that he seduced many illustrious women, among them 
              Postumia, wife of Servius Sulpicius, Lollia, wife of Aulus Gabinius, 
              Tertulla, wife of Marcus Crassus, and even Gnaeus Pompey's wife 
              Mucia. At all events there is no doubt that Pompey was taken to 
              task by the elder and the younger Curio, as well as by many others, 
              because through a desire for power he had afterwards married the 
              daughter of a man on whose account he divorced a wife who had borne 
              him three children, and whom he had often referred to with a groan 
              as an Aegisthus. But beyond all others Caesar loved Servilia, the 
              mother of Marcus Brutus, for whom in his first consulship he bought 
              a pearl costing six million sesterces. During the civil war, too, 
              besides other presents, he knocked down some fine estates to her 
              in a public auction at a nominal price, and when some expressed 
              their surprise at the low figure, Cicero wittily remarked: "It's 
              a better bargain than you think, for there is a third off." 
              And in fact it was thought that Servilia was prostituting her own 
              daughter Tertia to Caesar. 51.       That 
              he did not refrain from intrigues in the provinces is shown in particular 
              by this couplet, which was also shouted by the soldiers in his Gallic 
              triumph:                                "Men 
              of Rome, keep close to your consorts, here's a bald adulterer. 
                                             Gold 
              in Gaul you spent in dalliance, which you borrowed here in Rome." 52.       He 
              had love affairs with queens too, including Eunoe the Moor, wife 
              of Bogudes, on whom, as well as on her husband, he bestowed many 
              splendid presents, as Naso writes; but above all with Cleopatra, 
              with whom he often feasted until daybreak, and he would have gone 
              through Egypt with her in her state-barge almost to Aethiopia, had 
              not his soldiers refused to follow him. Finally he called her to 
              Rome and did not let her leave until he had ladened her with high 
              honours and rich gifts, and he allowed her to give his name to the 
              child which she bore. In fact, according to certain Greek writers, 
              this child was very like Caesar in looks and carriage. Mark Antony 
              declared to the senate that Caesar had really acknowledged the boy, 
              and that Gaius Matius, Gaius Oppius, and other friends of Caesar 
              knew this. Of these Gaius Oppius, as if admitting that the situation 
              required apology and defence, published a book, to prove that the 
              child whom Cleopatra fathered on Caesar was not his. Helvius Cinna, 
              tribune of the commons, admitted to several that he had a bill drawn 
              up in due form, which Caesar had ordered him to propose to the people 
              in his absence, making it lawful for Caesar to marry what wives 
              he wished, and as many as he wished, "for the purpose of begetting 
              children." But to remove all doubt that he had an evil reputation 
              both for shameless vice and for adultery, I have only to add that 
              the elder Curio in one of his speeches calls him "every woman's 
              man and every man's woman." 53.       That 
              he drank very little wine not even his enemies denied. There is 
              a saying of Marcus Cato that Caesar was the only man who undertook 
              to overthrow the state when sober. Even in the matter of food Gaius 
              Oppius tells us that he was so indifferent, that once when his host 
              served stale oil instead of fresh, and the other guests would have 
              none of it, Caesar partook even more plentifully than usual, not 
              to seem to charge his host with carelessness or lack of manners. 54.       Neither 
              when in command of armies nor as a magistrate at Rome did he show 
              a scrupulous integrity; for as certain man have declared in their 
              memoirs, when he was proconsul in Spain, he not only begged money 
              from the allies, to help pay his debts, but also attacked and sacked 
              some towns of the Lusitanians although they did not refuse his terms 
              and opened their gates to him on his arrival. In Gaul he pillaged 
              shrines and temples of the gods filled with offerings, and oftener 
              sacked towns for the sake of plunder than for any fault. In consequence 
              he had more gold than he knew what to do with, and offered it for 
              sale throughout Italy and the provinces at the rate of three thousand 
              sesterces the pound. In his first consulship he stole three thousand 
              pounds of gold from the Capitol, replacing it with the same weight 
              of gilded bronze. He made alliances and thrones a matter of barter, 
              for he extorted from Ptolemy alone in his own name and that of Pompey 
              nearly six thousand talents, while later on he met the heavy expenses 
              of the civil wars and of his triumphs and entertainments by the 
              most bare-faced pillage and sacrilege. 55.       In 
              eloquence and in the art of war he either equalled or surpassed 
              the fame of their most eminent representatives. After his accusation 
              of Dolabella, he was without question numbered with the leading 
              advocates. At all events when Cicero reviews the orators in his 
              Brutus, he says that he does not see to whom Caesar ought to yield 
              the palm, declaring that his style is elegant as well as transparent, 
              even grand and in a sense noble. Again in a letter to Cornelius 
              Nepos he writes thus of Caesar: "Come now, what orator would 
              you rank above him of those who have devoted themselves to nothing 
              else? Who has cleverer or more frequent epigrams? Who is either 
              more picturesque or more choice in diction?" He appears, at 
              least in his youth, to have imitated the manner of Caesar Strabo, 
              from whose speech entitled "For the Sardinians" he actually 
              transferred some passages word for word to a trial address of his 
              own. He is said to have delivered himself in a high-pitched voice 
              with impassioned action and gestures, which were not without grace. 
              He left several speeches, including some which are attributed to 
              him on insufficient evidence. Augustus had good reason to think 
              that the speech "For Quintus Metellus" was rather taken 
              down by shorthand writers who could not keep pace with his delivery, 
              than published by Caesar himself; for in some copies I find that 
              even the title is not "For Metellus," but, "Which 
              he wrote for Metellus," although the discourse purports to 
              be from Caesar's lips, defending Metellus and himself against the 
              charges of their common detractors. Augustus also questions the 
              authenticity of the address "To His Soldiers in Spain," 
              although there are two sections of it, one purporting to have been 
              spoken at the first battle, the other at the second, when Asinius 
              Pollio writes that because of the sudden onslaught of the enemy 
              he actually did not have time to make an harangue. 56.       He 
              left memoirs too of his deeds in the Gallic war and in the civil 
              strife with Pompey; for the author of the Alexandrian, African, 
              and Spanish Wars is unknown; some think it was Oppius, others Hirtius, 
              who also supplied the final book of the Gallic War, which Caesar 
              left unwritten. With regard to Caesar's memoirs Cicero, also in 
              the Brutus speaks in the following terms: "He wrote memoirs 
              which deserve the highest praise; they are naked in their simplicity, 
              straightforward yet graceful, stripped of all rhetorical adornment, 
              as of a garment; but while his purpose was to supply material to 
              others, on which those who wished to write history might draw, he 
              haply gratified silly folk, who will try to use the curling-irons 
              on his narrative, but he has kept men of any sense from touching 
              the subject." Of these same memoirs Hirtius uses this emphatic 
              language: "They are so highly rated in the judgment of all 
              men, that he seems to have deprived writers of an opportunity, rather 
              than given them one; yet our admiration for this feat is greater 
              than that of others; for they know how well and faultlessly he wrote, 
              while we know besides how easily and rapidly he finished his task." 
              Asinius Pollio thinks that they were put together somewhat carelessly 
              and without strict regard for truth; since in many cases Caesar 
              was too ready to believe the accounts which others gave of their 
              actions, and gave a perverted account of his own, either designedly 
              or perhaps from forgetfulness; and he thinks that he intended to 
              rewrite and revise them. He left besides a work in two volumes "On 
              Analogy," the same number of "Speeches criticising Cato," 
              in addition to a poem, entitled "The Journey." He wrote 
              the first of these works while crossing the Alps and returning to 
              his army from Hither Gaul, where he had held the assizes; the second 
              about the time of the battle of Munda, and the third in the course 
              of a twenty-four days' journey from Rome to Farther Spain. Some 
              letters of his to the senate are also preserved, and he seems to 
              have been the for to reduce such documents to pages and the form 
              of a note-book, whereas previously consuls and generals sent their 
              reports written right across the sheet. There are also letters of 
              his to Cicero, as well as to his intimates on private affairs, and 
              in the latter, if he had anything confidential to say, he wrote 
              it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the letters of 
              the alphabet, that not a word could be made out. If anyone wishes 
              to decipher these, and get at their meaning, he must substitute 
              the fourth letter of the alphabet, namely D, for A, and so with 
              the others. We also have mention of certain writings of his boyhood 
              and early youth, such as the "Praises of Hercules," a 
              tragedy "Oedipus," and a "Collection of Apophthegms"; 
              but Augustus forbade the publication of all these minor works in 
              a very brief and frank letter sent to Pompeius Macer, whom he had 
              selected to set his libraries in order. 57.       He 
              was highly skilled in arms and horsemanship, and of incredible powers 
              of endurance. On the march he headed his army, sometimes on horseback, 
              but oftener on foot, bareheaded both in the heat of the sun and 
              in rain. He covered great distances with incredible speed, making 
              a hundred miles a day in a hired carriage and with little baggage, 
              swimming the rivers which barred his path or crossing them on inflated 
              skins, and very often arriving before the messengers sent to announce 
              his coming. 58.       In 
              the conduct of his campaigns it is a question whether he was more 
              cautious or more daring, for he never led his army where ambuscades 
              were possible without carefully reconnoitring the country, and he 
              did not cross to Britain without making personal inquiries about 
              the harbours, the course, and the approach to the island. But on 
              the other hand, when news came that his camp in Germany was beleaguered, 
              he made his way to his men through the enemies' pickets, disguised 
              as a Gaul. He crossed from Brundisium to Dyrrachium in winter time, 
              running the blockade of the enemy's fleets; and when the troops 
              which he had ordered to follow him delayed to do so, and he had 
              sent to fetch them many times in vain, at last in secret and alone 
              he boarded a small boat at night with his head muffled up; and he 
              did not reveal who he was, or suffer the helmsman to give way to 
              the gale blowing in their teeth, until he was all but overwhelmed 
              by the waves. 59.       No 
              regard for religion ever turned him from any undertaking, or even 
              delayed him. Though the victim escaped as he was offering sacrifice, 
              he did not put off his expedition against Scipio and Juba. Even 
              when he had a fall as he disembarked, he gave the omen a favourable 
              turn by crying: "I hold thee fast, Africa." Furthermore, 
              to make the prophecies ridiculous which declared that the stock 
              of the Scipios was fated to be fortunate and invincible in that 
              province, he kept with him in camp a contemptible fellow belonging 
              to the Cornelian family, to whom the nickname Salvito had been given 
              as a reproach for his manner of life. 60.       He 
              joined battle, not only after planning his movements in advance 
              but on a sudden opportunity, often immediately at the end of a march, 
              and sometimes in the foulest weather, when one would least expect 
              him to make a move. It was not until his later years that he became 
              slower to engage, through a conviction that the oftener he had been 
              victor, the less he ought to tempt fate, and that he could not possibly 
              gain as much by success as he might lose by defeat. He never put 
              his enemy to flight without also driving him from his camp, thus 
              giving him no respite in his panic. When the issue was doubtful, 
              he used to send away the horses, and his own among the first, to 
              impose upon the troops the greater necessity of standing their ground 
              by taking away that aid to flight. 61.       He 
              rode a remarkable horse, too, with feet that were almost human; 
              for its hoofs were cloven in such a way as to look like toes. This 
              horse was foaled on his own place, and since the soothsayers had 
              declared that it foretold the rule of the world for its master, 
              he reared it with the greatest care, and was the first to mount 
              it, for it would endure no other rider. Afterwards, too, he dedicated 
              a statue of it before the temple of Venus Genetrix. 62.       When 
              his army gave way, he often rallied it single-handed, planting himself 
              in the way of the fleeing men, laying hold of them one by one, and 
              even catching them by the throat and forcing them to face the enemy; 
              that, too, when they were in such a panic that an eagle-bearer made 
              a pass at him with the point as he tried to stop him, while another 
              left the standard in Caesar's hand when he would hold him back. 63.       His 
              presence of mind was no less renowned, and the instances of it will 
              appear even more striking. After the battle of Pharsalus, when he 
              had sent on his troops and was crossing the strait of the Hellespont 
              in a small passenger boat, he met Lucius Cassius, of the hostile 
              party, with ten armoured ships, and made no attempt to escape, but 
              went to meet Cassius and actually urged him to surrender; and Cassius 
              sued for mercy and was taken on board. 64.       At 
              Alexandria, while assaulting a bridge, he was forced by a sudden 
              sally of the enemy to take to a small skiff; when many others threw 
              themselves into the same boat, he plunged into the sea, and after 
              swimming for two hundred paces, got away to the nearest ship, holding 
              up his left hand all the way, so as not to wet some papers which 
              he was carrying, and dragging his cloak after him with his teeth, 
              to keep the enemy from getting it as a trophy. 65.       He 
              valued his soldiers neither for their personal character nor for 
              their fortune, but solely for their prowess, and he treated them 
              with equal strictness and indulgence; for he did not curb them everywhere 
              and at all times, but only in the presence of the enemy. Then he 
              required the strictest discipline, not announcing the time of a 
              march or a battle, but keeping them ready and alert to be led on 
              a sudden at any moment wheresoever he might wish. He often called 
              them out even when there was no occasion for it, especially on rainy 
              days and holidays. And warning them every now and then that they 
              must keep close watch on him, he would steal away suddenly by day 
              or night and make a longer march than usual, to tire out those who 
              were tardy in following. 66.       When 
              they were in a panic through reports about the enemy's numbers, 
              he used to rouse their courage not by denying or discounting the 
              rumours, but by falsely exaggerating the true danger. For instance, 
              when the anticipation of Juba's coming filled them with terror, 
              he called the soldiers together and said: "Let me tell you 
              that within the next few days the king will be here with ten legions, 
              thirty thousand horsemen, a hundred thousand light-armed troops, 
              and three hundred elephants. Therefore some of you may as well cease 
              to ask further questions or make surmises and may rather believe 
              me, since I know all about it. Otherwise, I shall surely have them 
              shipped on some worn out craft and carried off to whatever lands 
              the wind may blow them." 67.       He 
              did not take notice of all their offences or punish them by rule, 
              but he kept a sharp look out for deserters and mutineers, and chastised 
              them most severely, shutting his eyes to other faults. Sometimes, 
              too, after a great victory he relieved of all duties and gave them 
              full licence to revel, being in the habit of boasting that his soldiers 
              could fight well even when reeking of perfumes. In the assembly 
              he addressed them not as "soldiers," but by the more flattering 
              term "comrades," and he kept them in fine trim, furnishing 
              them with arms inlaid with silver and gold, both for show and to 
              make them hold the faster to them in battle, through fear of the 
              greatness of the loss. Such was his love for them that when he heard 
              of the disaster to Titurius, he let his hair and beard grow long, 
              and would not cut them until he had taken vengeance. 68.       In 
              this way he made them most devoted to his interests as well as most 
              valiant. When he began the civil war, every centurion of each legion 
              proposed to supply a horseman from his own savings, and the soldiers 
              one and all offered their service without pay and without rations, 
              the richer assuming the care of the poorer. Throughout the long 
              struggle not one deserted and many of them, on being taken prisoner, 
              refused to accept their lives, when offered them on the condition 
              of consenting to serve against Caesar. They bore hunger and other 
              hardships, both when in a state of siege and when besieging others, 
              with such fortitude, that when Pompey saw in the works at Dyrrachium 
              a kind of bread made of herbs, on which they were living, he said 
              that he was fighting wild beasts; and he gave orders that it be 
              put out of sight quickly and shown to none of his men, for fear 
              that the endurance and resolution of the foe would break their spirit.
                   How valiantly they fought is shown 
              by the fact that when they suffered their sole defeat before Dyrrachium, 
              they insisted on being punished, and their commander felt called 
              upon rather to console them than to chastise them. In the other 
              battles they overcame with ease countless forces of the enemy, though 
              decidedly fewer in number themselves. Indeed one cohort of the sixth 
              legion, when set to defend a redoubt, kept four legions of Pompey 
              at bay for several hours, though almost all were wounded by the 
              enemy's showers of arrows, of which a hundred and thirty thousand 
              were picked up within the ramparts. And no wonder, when one thinks 
              of the deeds of individual soldiers, either of Cassius Scaeva the 
              centurion, or of Gaius Acilius of the rank and file, not to mention 
              others. Scaeva, with one eye gone, his thigh and shoulder wounded, 
              and his shield bored through in a hundred and twenty places, continued 
              to guard the gate of a fortress put in his charge. Acilius in the 
              sea-fight at Massilia grasped the stern of one of the enemy's ships, 
              and when his right hand was lopped off, rivalling the famous exploit 
              of the Greek hero Cynegirus, boarded the ship and drove the enemy 
              before him with the boss of his shield. 69.       They 
              did not mutiny once during the ten years of the Gallic war; in the 
              civil wars they did so now and then, but quickly resumed their duty, 
              not so much owing to any indulgence of their general as to his authority. 
              For he never gave way to them when they were insubordinate, but 
              always boldly faced them, discharging the entire ninth legion in 
              disgrace before Placentia, though Pompey was still in the field, 
              reinstating them unwillingly and only after many abject entreaties, 
              and insisting on punish the ringleaders. 70.       Again 
              at Rome, when the men of the Tenth clamoured for their discharge 
              and rewards with terrible threats and no little peril to the city, 
              though the war in Africa was then raging, he did not hesitate to 
              appear before them, against the advice of his friends, and to disband 
              them. But with a single word, calling them "citizens," 
              instead of "soldiers," he easily brought them round and 
              bent them to his will; for they at once replied that they were his 
              "soldiers" and insisted on following him to Africa, although 
              he refused their service. Even then he punished the most insubordinate 
              by the loss of a third part of the booty and of the land intended 
              for them. 71.       Even 
              when a young man he showed no lack of devotion and fidelity to his 
              dependents. He defended Masintha, a youth of high birth, against 
              king Hiempsal with such spirit, that in the dispute he caught the 
              king's son Juba by the beard. On Masintha's being declared tributary 
              to the king, he at once rescued him from those who would carry him 
              off and kept him hidden for some time in his own house; and when 
              presently he left for Spain after his praetorship, he carried the 
              young man off in his own litter, unnoticed amid the crowd that came 
              to see him off and the lictors with their faces. 72.       His 
              friends he treated with invariable kindness and consideration. When 
              Gaius Oppius was his companion on a journey through a wild, woody 
              country and was suddenly taken ill, Caesar gave up to him the only 
              shelter there was, while he himself slept on the ground out-of-doors. 
              Moreover, when he came to power, he advanced some of his friends 
              to the highest positions, even though they were of the humblest 
              origin, and when taken to task for it, flatly declared that if he 
              had been helped in defending his honour by brigands and cut-throats, 
              he would have requited even such men in the same way. 73.       On 
              the other hand he never formed such bitter enmities that he was 
              not glad to lay them aside when opportunity offered. Although Gaius 
              Memmius had made highly caustic speeches against him, to which he 
              had replied with equal bitterness, he went so far as to support 
              Memmius afterwards in his suit for the consulship. When Gaius Calvus, 
              after some scurrilous epigrams, took steps through his friends towards 
              a reconciliation, Caesar wrote to him first and of his own free 
              will. Valerius Catullus, as Caesar himself did not hesitate to say, 
              inflicted a lasting stain on his name by the verses about Mamurra; 
              yet when he apologised, Caesar invited the poet to dinner that very 
              same day, and continued his usual friendly relations with Catullus's 
              father. 74.       Even 
              in avenging wrongs he was by nature most merciful, and when he got 
              hold of the pirates who had captured him, he had them crucified, 
              since he had sworn beforehand that he would do so, but ordered that 
              their throats be cut first. He could never make up his mind to harm 
              Cornelius Phagites, although when he was sick and in hiding, the 
              man had waylaid him night after night, and even a bribe had barely 
              saved him from being handed over to Sulla. The slave Philemon, his 
              amanuensis, who had promised Caesar's enemies that he would poison 
              him, he merely punished by death, without torture. When summoned 
              as a witness against Publius Clodius, the paramour of his wife Pompeia, 
              charged on the same count with sacrilege, Caesar declared that he 
              had no evidence, although both his mother Aurelia and his sister 
              Julia had given the same jurors a faithful account of the whole 
              affair; and on being asked why it was then that he had put away 
              his wife, he replied: "Because I maintain that the members 
              of my family should be free from suspicion, as well as from accusation." 75.       He 
              certainly showed admirable self-restraint and mercy, both in his 
              conduct of the civil war and in the hour of victory. While Pompey 
              announced that he would treat as enemies those who did not take 
              up arms for the government, Caesar gave out that those who were 
              neutral and of neither party would be numbered with his friends. 
              He freely allowed all those whom he had made centurions on Pompey's 
              recommendation to go over to his rival. When conditions of surrender 
              were under discussion at Ilerda, and friendly intercourse between 
              the two parties was constant, Afranius and Petreius, with a sudden 
              change of purpose, put to death all of Caesar's soldiers whom they 
              found in their camp; but Caesar could not bring himself to retaliate 
              in kind. At the battle of Pharsalus he cried out, "Spare your 
              fellow citizens," and afterwards allowed each of his men to 
              save any one man he pleased of the opposite party. And it will be 
              found that no Pompeian lost his life except in battle, save only 
              Afranius and Faustus, and the young Lucius Caesar; and it is believed 
              that not even these men were slain by his wish, even though the 
              two former had taken up arms again after being pardoned, while Caesar 
              had not only cruelly put to death the dictator's slaves and freedmen 
              with fire and sword, but had even butchered the wild beasts which 
              he had procured for the entertainment of the people. At last, in 
              his later years, he went so far as to allow all those whom he had 
              not yet pardoned to return to Italy, and to hold magistracies and 
              the command of armies: and he actually set up the statues of Lucius 
              Sulla and Pompey, which had been broken to pieces by the populace. 
              After this, if any dangerous plots were formed against him, or slanders 
              uttered, he preferred to quash rather than to punish them. Accordingly, 
              he took no further notice of the conspiracies which were detected, 
              and of meetings by night, than to make known by proclamation that 
              he was aware of them; and he thought it enough to give public warning 
              to those who spoke ill of him, not to persist in their conduct, 
              bearing with good nature the attacks on his reputation made by the 
              scurrilous volume of Aulus Caecina and the abusive lampoons of Pitholaus. 76.       Yet 
              after all, his other actions and word so turn the scale, that it 
              is thought that he abused his power and was justly slain. For not 
              only did he accept excessive honours, such as an uninterrupted consulship, 
              the dictatorship for life, and the censorship of public morals, 
              as well as the forename Imperator, the surname of Father of his 
              Country, a statue among those of the kings, and a raised couch in 
              the orchestra; but he also allowed honours to be bestowed on him 
              which were too great for mortal man: a golden throne in the House 
              and on the judgment seat; a chariot and litter in the procession 
              at the circus; temples, altars, and statues beside those of the 
              gods; a special priest, an additional college of the Luperci, and 
              the calling of one of the months by his name. In fact, there were 
              no honours which he did not receive or confer at pleasure.
                   He held his third and fourth consulships 
              in name only, content with the power of the dictatorship conferred 
              on him at the same time as the consulships. Moreover, in both years 
              he substituted two consuls for himself for the last three months, 
              in the meantime holding no elections except for tribunes and plebeian 
              aediles, and appointing praefects instead of the praetors, to manage 
              the affairs of the city during his absence. When one of the consuls 
              suddenly died the day before the Kalends of January, he gave the 
              vacant office for a few hours to a man who asked for it. With the 
              same disregard of law and precedent he named magistrates for several 
              years to come, bestowed the emblems of consular rank on ten ex-praetors, 
              and admitted to the House men who had been given citizenship, and 
              in some cases half-civilised Gauls. He assigned the charge of the 
              mint and of the public revenues to his own slaves, and gave the 
              oversight and command of the three legions which he had left at 
              Alexandria to a favourite of his called Rufio, son of one of his 
              freedmen. 77.       No 
              less arrogant were his public utterances, which Titus Ampius records: 
              that the state was nothing, a mere name without body or form; that 
              Sulla did not know his A. B. C. when he laid down his dictatorship; 
              that men ought now to be more circumspect in addressing him, and 
              to regard his word as law. So far did he go in his presumption, 
              that when a soothsayer once reported direful inwards without a heart, 
              he said: "They will be more favourable when I wish it; it should 
              not be regarded as a portent, if a beast has no heart." 78.       But 
              it was the following action in particular that roused deadly hatred 
              against him. When the Senate approached him in a body with many 
              highly honorary decrees, he received them before the temple of Venus 
              Genetrix without rising. Some think that when he attempted to get 
              up, he was held back by Cornelius Balbus; others, that he made no 
              such move at all, but on the contrary frowned angrily on Gaius Trebatius 
              when he sued that he should rise. And this action of his seemed 
              the more intolerable, because when he himself in one of his triumphal 
              processions rode past the benches of the tribunes, he was so incensed 
              because a member of the college, Pontius Aquila, did not rise, that 
              he cried: "Come then, Aquila, take back the republic from me, 
              you tribune"; and for several days he would not make a promise 
              to any one without adding, "That is, if Pontius Aquila will 
              allow me." 79.       To 
              an insult which so plainly showed his contempt for the Senate he 
              added an act of even greater insolence; for at the Latin Festival, 
              as he was returning to the city, amid the extravagant and unprecedented 
              demonstrations of the populace, someone in the press placed on his 
              statue a laurel wreath with a white fillet tied to it; and when 
              Epidius Marullus and Caesetius Flavius, tribunes of the commons, 
              gave orders that the ribbon be removed from the wreath and the man 
              taken off to prison, Caesar sharply rebuked and deposed them, either 
              offended that the hint at regal power had been received with so 
              little favour, or, as he asserted, that he had been robbed of the 
              glory of refusing it. But from that time on he could not rid himself 
              of the odium of having aspired to the title of monarch, although 
              he replied to the commons, when they hailed him as king, "I 
              am Caesar and no king," and at the Lupercalia, when the consul 
              Antony several times attempted to place a crown upon his head as 
              he spoke from the rostra, he put it aside and at last sent it to 
              the Capitol, to be offered to Jupiter Optimus Maximus. Nay, more, 
              the report had spread in various quarters that he intended to move 
              to Ilium or Alexandria, taking with him the resources of the state, 
              draining Italy by levies, and leaving the charge of the city to 
              his friends; also that at the next meeting of the Senate Lucius 
              Cotta would announce as the decision of Fifteen, that inasmuch as 
              it was written in the books of fate that the Parthians could be 
              conquered only by a king, Caesar should be given that title. 80.      It 
              was this that led the conspirators to hasten in carrying out their 
              designs, in order to avoid giving their assent to this proposal.
                   Therefore the plots which had previously 
              been formed separately, often by groups of two or three, were united 
              in a general conspiracy, since even the populace no longer were 
              pleased with present conditions, but both secretly and openly rebelled 
              at his tyranny and cried out for defenders of their liberty. On 
              the admission of foreigners to the Senate, a placard was posted: 
              "God bless the Commonwealth! let no one consent to point out 
              the House to a newly made senator." The following verses too 
              were sung everywhere:                                 "Caesar 
              led the Gauls in triumph, led them to the senate house;
                                              Then 
              the Gauls put off their breeches, and put on the laticlave."      When 
              Quintus Maximus, whom he had appointed consul in his place for three 
              months, was entering the theatre, and his lictor called attention 
              to his arrival in the usual manner, a general shout was raised: 
              "He's no consul!" At the first election after the deposing 
              of Caesetius and Marullus, the tribunes, several votes were found 
              for their appointment as consuls. Some wrote on the base of Lucius 
              Brutus' statue: "Oh, that you were still alive"; and on 
              that of Caesar himself:                                 "First 
              of all was Brutus consul, since he drove the kings from Rome;
                                              Since 
              this man drove out the consuls, he at last is made our king."      More 
              than sixty joined the conspiracy against him, led by Gaius Cassius 
              and Marcus and Decimus Brutus. At first they hesitated whether to 
              form two divisions at the elections in the Campus Martius, so that 
              while some hurled him from the bridge as he summoned the tribes 
              to vote, the rest might wait below and slay him; or to set upon 
              him in the Sacred Way or at the entrance to the theatre. When, however, 
              a meeting of the Senate was called for the Ides of March in the 
              Hall of Pompey, they readily gave that time and place the preference. 81.       Now 
              Caesar's approaching murder was foretold to him by unmistakable 
              signs. A few months before, when the settlers assigned to the colony 
              at Capua by the Julian Law were demolishing some tombs of great 
              antiquity, to build country houses, and plied their work with the 
              greater vigour because as they rummaged about they found a quantity 
              of vases of ancient workmanship, there was discovered in a tomb, 
              which was said to be that of Capys, the founder of Capua, a bronze 
              tablet, inscribed with Greek words and characters to this purport: 
              "Whenever the bones of Capys shall be moved, it will come to 
              pass that a son of Ilium shall be slain at the hands of his kindred, 
              and presently avenged at heavy cost to Italy." And let no one 
              think this tale a myth or a lie, for it is vouched for by Cornelius 
              Balbus, an intimate friend of Caesar. Shortly before his death, 
              as he was told, the herds of horses which he had dedicated to the 
              river Rubicon when he crossed it, and had let loose without a keeper, 
              stubbornly refused to graze and wept copiously. Again, when he was 
              offering sacrifice, the soothsayer Spurinna warned him to beware 
              of danger, which would come not later than the Ides of March; and 
              on the day before the Ides of that month a little bird called the 
              king-bird flew into the Hall of Pompey with a sprig of laurel, pursued 
              by others of various kinds from the grove hard by, which tore it 
              to pieces in the hall. In fact the very night before his murder 
              he dreamt now that he was flying above the clouds, and now that 
              he was clasping the hand of Jupiter; and his wife Calpurnia thought 
              that the pediment of their house fell, and that her husband was 
              stabbed in her arms; and on a sudden the door of the room flew open 
              of its own accord.
                   Both for these reasons and because of poor health 
              he hesitated for a long time whether to stay at home and put off 
              what he had planned to do in the senate; but at last, urged by Decimus 
              Brutus not to disappoint the full meeting which had for some time 
              been waiting for him, he went forth almost at the end of the fifth 
              hour; and when a note revealing the plot was handed him by someone 
              on the way, he put it with others which he held in his left hand, 
              intending to read them presently. Then, after several victims had 
              been slain, and he could get favourable omens, laughing at Spurinna 
              and calling him a false prophet, because the Ides of March were 
              come without bringing him harm; though Spurinna replied that they 
              had of a truth come, but they had not gone. 82.       As 
              he took his seat, the conspirators gathered about him as if to pay 
              their respects, and straightway Tillius Cimber, who had assumed 
              the lead, came nearer as though to ask something; and when Caesar 
              with a gesture put him off to another time, Cimber caught his toga 
              by both shoulders; then as Caesar cried, "Why, this is violence!" 
              one of the Cascas stabbed him from one side just below the throat. 
              Caesar caught Casca's arm and ran it through with his stylus, but 
              as he tried to leap to his feet, he was stopped by another wound. 
              When he saw that he was beset on every side by drawn daggers, he 
              muffled his head in his robe, and at the same time drew down its 
              lap to his feet with his left hand, in order to fall more decently, 
              with the lower part of his body also covered. And in this wise he 
              was stabbed with three and twenty wounds, uttering not a word, but 
              merely a groan at the first stroke, though some have written that 
              when Marcus Brutus rushed at him, he said in Greek, "You too, 
              my child?" All the conspirators made off, and he lay there 
              lifeless for some time, and finally three common slaves put him 
              on a litter and carried him home, with one arm hanging down. And 
              of so many wounds none turned out to be mortal, in the opinion of 
              the physician Antistius, except the second one in the breast.
                   The conspirators had intended after 
              slaying him to drag his body to the Tiber, confiscate his property, 
              and revoke his decrees; but they forebore through fear of Marcus 
              Antonius the consul, and Lepidus, the master of horse. 83.       Then 
              at the request of his father-in-law, Lucius Piso, the will was unsealed 
              and read in Antony's house, which Caesar had made on the preceding 
              Ides of September at his place near Lavicum, and put in the care 
              of the chief of the Vestals. Quintus Tubero states that from his 
              first consulship until the beginning of the civil war it was his 
              wont to write down Gnaeus Pompeius as his heir, and to read this 
              to the assembled soldiers. In his last will, however, he named three 
              heirs, his sisters' grandsons, Gaius Octavius, to three-fourths 
              of his estate, and Lucius Pinarius and Quintus Pedius to share the 
              remainder. At the end of the will, too, he adopted Gaius Octavius 
              into his family and gave him his name. He named several of his assassins 
              among the guardians of his son, in case one should be born to him, 
              and Decimus Brutus even among his heirs in the second degree. To 
              the people he left his gardens near the Tiber for their common use 
              and three hundred sesterces to each man. 84.       When 
              the funeral was announced, a pyre was erected in the Campus Martius 
              near the tomb of Julia, and on the rostra a gilded shrine was placed, 
              made after the model of the temple of Venus Genetrix; within was 
              a couch of ivory with coverlets of purple and gold, and at its head 
              a pillar hung with the robe in which he was slain. Since it was 
              clear that the day would not be long enough for those who offered 
              gifts, they were directed to bring them to the Campus by whatsoever 
              streets of the city they wished, regardless of any order of precedence. 
              At the funeral games, to rouse pity and indignation at his death, 
              these words from the "Contest for the Arms" of Pacuvius 
              were sung:                                              "Saved 
              I these men that they might murder me?" and words 
              of like purport from the "Electra" of Atilius. Instead 
              of a eulogy the consul Antonius caused a herald to recite the decree 
              of the Senate in which it had voted Caesar all divine and human 
              honours at once, and likewise the oath with which they had all pledged 
              themselves to watch over his personal safety; to which he added 
              a very few words of his own. The bier on the rostra was carried 
              down into the Forum by magistrates and ex-magistrates; and while 
              some were urging that it be burned in the temple of Jupiter on the 
              Capitol, and others in the Hall of Pompey, on a sudden two beings 
              with swords by their sides and brandishing a pair of darts set fire 
              to it with blazing torches, and at once the throng of bystanders 
              heaped upon it dry branches, the judgment seats with the benches, 
              and whatever else could serve as an offering. Then the musicians 
              and actors tore off their robes, which they had taken from the equipment 
              of his triumphs and put on for the occasion, rent them to bits and 
              threw them into the flames, and the veterans of the legions the 
              arms with which they had adorned themselves for the funeral; many 
              of the women too, offered up the jewels which they wore and the 
              amulets and robes of their children.
                   At the height of the public grief a throng of 
              foreigners went about lamenting each after the fashion of his country, 
              above all the Jews, who even flocked to the place for several successive 
              nights. 85.       Immediately 
              after the funeral the commons ran to the houses of Brutus and Cassius 
              with firebrands, and after being repelled with difficulty, they 
              slew Helvius Cinna when they met him, through a mistake in the name, 
              supposing that he was Cornelius Cinna, who had the day before made 
              a bitter indictment of Caesar and for whom they were looking; and 
              they set his head upon a spear and paraded it about the streets. 
              Afterwards they set up in the Forum a solid column of Numidian marble 
              almost twenty feet high, and inscribed upon it, "To the Father 
              of his Country." At the foot of this they continued for a long 
              time to sacrifice, make vows, and settle some of their disputes 
              by an oath in the name of Caesar. 86.       Caesar 
              left in the minds of some of his friends the suspicion that he did 
              not wish to live longer and had taken no precautions, because of 
              his failing health; and that therefore he neglected the warnings 
              which came to him from portents and from the reports of his friends. 
              Some think that it was because he had full trust in the last decree 
              of the senators and their oath that he dismissed even the armed 
              bodyguard of Spanish soldiers that formerly attended him. Others, 
              on the contrary, believe that he elected to expose himself once 
              for all to the plots that threatened him on every hand, rather than 
              to be always anxious and on his guard. Some, too, say that he was 
              wont to declare that it was not so much to his own interest as to 
              that of his country that he remain alive; he had long since had 
              his fill of power and glory; but if aught befell him, the commonwealth 
              would have no peace, but would be plunged in strife under much worse 
              conditions. 87.       About 
              one thing almost all are fully agreed, that he all but desired such 
              a death as he met; for once when he read in Xenophon how Cyrus in 
              his last illness gave directions for his funeral, he expressed his 
              horror of such a lingering kind of end and his wish for one which 
              was swift and sudden. And the day before his murder, in a conversation 
              which arose at a dinner at the house of Marcus Lepidus, as to what 
              manner of death was most to be desired, he had given his preference 
              to one which was sudden and unexpected. 88.       He 
              died in the fifty-sixth year of his age, and was numbered among 
              the gods, not only by a formal decree, but also in the conviction 
              of the common people. For at the first of the games which his heir 
              Augustus gave in honour of his apotheosis, a comet shone for seven 
              successive days, rising about the eleventh hour, and was believed 
              to be the soul of Caesar, who had been taken to heaven; and this 
              is why a star is set upon the crown of his head in his statue.
                   It was voted that the hall in which 
              he was slain be walled up, that the Ides of March be called the 
              Day of Parricide, and that a meeting of the senate should never 
              be called on that day.  89.      Hardly 
              any of his assassins survived him for more than three years, or 
              died a natural death. They were all condemned, and they perished 
              in various ways — some by shipwreck, some in battle; some took their 
              own lives with the self-same dagger with which they had impiously 
              slain Caesar.
