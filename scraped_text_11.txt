SUETONIUS THE 
            LIVES OF THE TWELVE CAESARS ~   THE 
            LIFE OF TITUS   ~   1.      Titus, 
              of the same surname as his father, was the delight and darling of 
              the human race; such surpassing ability had he, by nature, art, 
              or good fortune, to win the affections of all men, and that, too, 
              which is no easy task, while he was emperor; for as a private citizen, 
              and even during his father's rule, he did not escape hatred, much 
              less public criticism.
                   He was born on the third day before 
              the Kalends of January, in the year memorable for the death of Gaius, 
              in a mean house near the Septizonium and in a very small dark room 
              besides; for it still remains and is on exhibition. 2.      He 
              was brought up at court in company with Britannicus and taught the 
              same subjects by the same masters. At that time, so they say, a 
              physiognomist was brought in by Narcissus, the freedman of Claudius, 
              to examine Britannicus and declared most positively that he would 
              never become emperor; but that Titus, who was standing near by at 
              the time, would surely rule. The boys were so intimate too, that 
              it is believed that when Britannicus drained the fatal draught, 
              Titus, who was reclining at his side, also tasted of the potion 
              and for a long time suffered from an obstinate disorder. Titus did 
              not forget all this, but later set up a golden statue of his friend 
              in the Palace, and dedicated another equestrian statue of ivory, 
              which is to this day carried in the procession in the Circus, and 
              he attended it on its first appearance. 3.       Even 
              in boyhood his bodily and mental gifts were conspicuous and they 
              became more and more so as he advanced in years. He had a handsome 
              person, in which there was no less dignity than grace, and was uncommonly 
              strong, although he was not tall of stature and had a rather protruding 
              belly. His memory was extraordinary and he had an aptitude for almost 
              all the arts, both of war and of peace. Skilful in arms and horsemanship, 
              he made speeches and wrote verses in Latin and Greek with ease and 
              readiness, and even off-hand. He was besides not unacquainted with 
              music, but sang and played the harp agreeably and skilfully. I have 
              heard from many sources that he used also to write shorthand with 
              great speed and would amuse himself by playful contests with his 
              secretaries; also that he could imitate any handwriting that he 
              had ever seen and often declared that he might have been the prince 
              of forgers. 4.       He 
              served as military tribune both in Germany and in Britain, winning 
              a high reputation for energy and no less integrity, as is evident 
              from the great number of his statues and busts in both those provinces 
              and from the inscriptions they bear.
                   After his military service he pleaded 
              in the Forum, rather for glory than as a profession, and at the 
              same time took to wife Arrecina Tertulla, whose father, though only 
              a Roman knight, had once been prefect of the praetorian cohorts; 
              on her death he replaced her by Marcia Furnilla, a lady of a very 
              distinguished family, but divorced her after he had acknowledged 
              a daughter which she bore him.
                   Then, after holding the office of 
              quaestor, as commander of a legion he subjugated the two strong 
              cities of Tarichaeae and Gamala in Judaea, having his horse killed 
              under him in one battle and mounting another, whose rider had fallen 
              fighting by his side. 5.       Presently 
              he was sent to congratulate Galba on becoming ruler of the state, 
              and attracted attention wherever he went, through the belief that 
              he had been sent for to be adopted. But observing that everything 
              was once more in a state of turmoil, he turned back, and visiting 
              the oracle of the Paphian Venus, to consult it about his voyage, 
              he was also encouraged to hope for imperial power. Soon realising 
              his hope and left behind to complete the conquest of Judaea, in 
              the final attack on Jerusalem he slew twelve of the defenders with 
              as many arrows; and he took the city on his daughter's birthday, 
              so delighting the soldiers and winning their devotion that they 
              hailed him as Imperator and detained him from time to time, when 
              he would leave the province, urging him with prayers and even with 
              threats either to stay or to take them all with him. This aroused 
              the suspicion that he had tried to revolt from his father and make 
              himself king of the East; and he strengthened this suspicion on 
              his way to Alexandria by wearing a diadem at the consecration of 
              the bull Apis in Memphis, an act quite in accord with the usual 
              ceremonial of that ancient religion, but unfavourably interpreted 
              by some. Because of this he hastened to Italy, and putting in at 
              Regium and then at Puteoli in a transport ship, he went with all 
              speed from there to Rome, where as if to show that the reports about 
              him were groundless, he surprised his father with the greeting, 
              "I am here, father; I am here." 6.       From 
              that time on he never ceased to act as the emperor's partner and 
              even as his protector. He took part in his father's triumph and 
              was censor with him. He was also his colleague in the tribunicial 
              power and in seven consulships. He took upon himself the discharge 
              of almost all duties, personally dictated letters and wrote edicts 
              in his father's name, and even read his speeches in the senate in 
              lieu of a quaestor. He also assumed the command of the praetorian 
              guard, which before that time had never been held except by a Roman 
              knight, and in this office conducted himself in a somewhat arrogant 
              and tyrannical fashion. For whenever he himself regard anyone with 
              suspicion, he would secretly send some of the Guard to the various 
              theatres and camps, to demand their punishment as if by consent 
              of all who were present; and then he would put them out of the way 
              without delay. Among these was Aulus Caecina, an ex-consul, whom 
              he invited to dinner and then ordered to be stabbed almost before 
              he left the dining-room; but in this case he was led by a pressing 
              danger, having got possession of an autograph copy of an harangue 
              which Caecina had prepared to deliver to the soldiers. Although 
              by such conduct he provided for his safety in the future, he incurred 
              such odium at the time that hardly anyone ever came to the throne 
              with so evil a reputation or so much against the desires of all. 7.       Besides 
              cruelty, he was also suspected of riotous living, since he protracted 
              his revels until the middle of the night with the most prodigal 
              of his friends; likewise of unchastity because of his troops of 
              catamites and eunuchs, and his notorious passion for queen Berenice, 
              to whom it was even said that he promised marriage. He was suspected 
              of greed as well; for it was well known that in cases which came 
              before his father he put a price on his influence and accepted bribes. 
              In short, people not only thought, but openly declared, that he 
              would be a second Nero. But this reputation turned out to his advantage 
              and gave place to the highest praise, when no fault was discovered 
              in him, but on the contrary the highest virtues.
                   His banquets were pleasant rather 
              than extravagant. He chose as his friends men whom succeeding emperors 
              also retained as indispensable alike to themselves and to the State, 
              and of whose services they made special use. Berenice he sent from 
              Rome at once, against her will and against his own. Some of his 
              most beloved paramours, although they were such skilful dancers 
              that they later became stage favourites, he not only ceased to cherish 
              any longer, but even to witness their public performances.
                   He took away nothing from any citizen. 
              He respected others' property, if anyone ever did; in fact, he would 
              not accept even proper and customary presents. And yet he was second 
              to none of his predecessors in munificence. At the dedication of 
              his amphitheatre and of the baths which were hastily built near 
              it he gave a most magnificent and costly gladiatorial show. He presented 
              a sham sea-fight too in the old naumachia, and in the same place 
              a combat of gladiators, exhibiting five thousand wild beasts of 
              every kind in a single day. 8.       He 
              was most kindly by nature, and whereas in accordance with a custom 
              established by Tiberius, all the Caesars who followed him refused 
              to regard favours granted by previous emperors as valid, unless 
              they had themselves conferred the same ones on the same individuals, 
              Titus was the first to ratify them all in a single edict, without 
              allowing himself to be asked. Moreover, in the case of other requests 
              made of him, it was his fixed rule not to let anyone go away without 
              hope. Even when his household officials warned him that he was promising 
              more than he could perform, he said that it was not right for anyone 
              to go away sorrowful from an interview with his emperor. On another 
              occasion, remembering at dinner that he had nothing for anybody 
              all day, he gave utterance to that memorable and praiseworthy remark: 
              "Friends, I have lost a day."
                   The whole body of the people in particular 
              he treated with such indulgence on all occasions, that once at a 
              gladiatorial show he declared that he would give it, "not after 
              his own inclinations, but those of the spectators"; and what 
              is more, he kept his word. For he refused nothing which anyone asked, 
              and even urged them to ask for what they wished. Furthermore, he 
              openly displayed his partiality for Thracian gladiators and bantered 
              the people about it by words and gestures, always however preserving 
              his dignity, as well as observing justice. Not to omit any act of 
              condescension, he sometimes bathed in the baths which he had built, 
              in company with the common people.
                   There were some dreadful disasters 
              during his reign, such as the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in Campania, 
              a fire at Rome which continued three days and as many nights, and 
              a plague the like of which had hardly ever been known before. In 
              these many great calamities he showed not merely the concern of 
              an emperor, but even a father's surpassing love, now offering consolation 
              in edicts, and now lending aid so far as his means allowed. He chose 
              commissioners by lot from among the ex-consuls for the relief of 
              Campania; and the property of those who lost their lives by Vesuvius 
              and had no heirs left alive he applied to the rebuilding of the 
              buried cities. During the fire in Rome he made no remark except 
              "I am ruined," and he set aside all the ornaments of his 
              villas for the public buildings and temples, and put several men 
              of the equestrian order in charge of the work, that everything might 
              be done with the greater dispatch. For curing the plague and diminishing 
              the force of the epidemic there was no aid, human or divine, which 
              he did not employ, searching for every kind of sacrifice and all 
              kinds of medicines.
                   Among the evils of the times were 
              the informers and their instigators, who had enjoyed a long standing 
              licence. After these had been soundly beaten in the Forum with scourges 
              and cudgels, and finally led in procession across the arena of the 
              amphitheatre, he had some of them put up and sold, and others deported 
              to the wildest of the islands. To further discourage for all time 
              any who might think of venturing on similar practices, among other 
              precautions he made it unlawful for anyone to be tried under several 
              laws for the same offence, or for any inquiry to be made as to the 
              legal status of any deceased person after a stated number of years. 9.       Having 
              declared that he would accept the office of pontifex maximus for 
              the purpose of keeping his hands unstained, he was true to his promise; 
              for after that he neither caused nor connived at the death of any 
              man, although he sometimes had no lack of reasons for taking vengeance; 
              but he swore that he would rather be killed than kill. When two 
              men of patrician family were found guilty of aspiring to the throne, 
              he satisfied himself with warning them to abandon their attempt, 
              saying that imperial power was the gift of fate, and promising that 
              if there was anything else they desired, he himself would bestow 
              it. Then he sent his couriers with all speed to the mother of one 
              of them, for she was some distance off, to relieve her anxiety by 
              reporting that her son was safe; and he not only invited the men 
              themselves to dinner among his friends, but on the following day 
              at a gladiatorial show he purposely placed them near him, and when 
              the swords of the contestants were offered him, handed them over 
              for their inspection. It is even said that inquiring into the horoscope 
              of each of them, he declared that danger threatened them both, but 
              at some future time and from another, as turned out to be the case.
                   Although his brother never ceased 
              plotting against him, but almost openly stirred up the armies to 
              revolt and meditated flight to them, he had not the heart to put 
              him to death or banish him from the court, or even to hold him in 
              less honour than before. On the contrary, as he had done from the 
              very first day of his rule, he continued to declare that he was 
              his partner and successor, and sometimes he privately begged him 
              with tears and prayers to be willing at least to return his affection. 10.       In 
              the meantime he was cut off by death, to the loss of mankind rather 
              than to his own. After finishing the public games, at the close 
              of which he wept bitterly in the presence of the people, he went 
              down to the Sabine territory, somewhat cast down because a victim 
              had escaped as he was sacrificing and because it had thundered from 
              a clear sky. Then at the very first stopping place he was seized 
              with a fever, and as he was being carried on from there in a litter, 
              it is said that he pushed back the curtains, looked up to heaven, 
              and lamented bitterly that his life was being taken from him contrary 
              to his deserts; for he said that there was no act of his life of 
              which he had cause to repent, save one only. What this was he did 
              not himself disclose at the time, nor could anyone easily divine. 
              Some think that he recalled the intimacy which he had with his brother's 
              wife; but Domitia swore most solemnly that this did not exist, although 
              she would not have denied it if it had been in the least true, but 
              on the contrary would have boasted of it, as she was most ready 
              to do of all her scandalous actions. 11.       He 
              died in the same farmhouse as his father, on the Ides of September, 
              two years two months and twenty days after succeeding Vespasian, 
              in the forty-second year of his age. When his death was made known, 
              the whole populace mourned as they would for a loss in their own 
              families, the senate hastened to the House before it was summoned 
              by proclamation, and with the doors still shut, and then with them 
              open, rendered such thanks to him and heaped such praise on him 
              after death as they had never done even when he was alive and present.
